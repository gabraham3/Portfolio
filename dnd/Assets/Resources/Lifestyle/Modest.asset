  Description: A modest lifestyle keeps you out of the slums and ensures that you
    can maintain your equipment. You live in an older part of town, renting a room
    in a boarding house, inn, or temple. You don't go hungry or thirsty, and your
    living conditions are clean, if simple. Ordinary people living modest lifestyles
    include soldiers with families, laborers, students, priests, hedge wizards, and
    the like.
