  Description: Choosing a wealthy lifestyle means living a life of luxury, though
    you might not have achieved the social status associated with the old money of
    nobility or royalty. You live a lifestyle comparable to that of a highly successful
    merchant, a favored servant of the royalty, or the owner of a few small businesses.
    You have respectable lodgings, usually a spacious home in a good part of town
    or a comfortable suite at a fine inn. You likely have a small staff of servants.
