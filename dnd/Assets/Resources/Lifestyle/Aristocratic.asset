  Description: You live a life of plenty and comfort. You move in circles populated
    by the most powerful people in the community. You have excellent lodgings, perhaps
    a townhouse in the nicest part of town or rooms in the finest inn. You dine at
    the best restaurants, retain the most skilled and fashionable tailor, and have
    servants attending to your every need. You receive invitations to the social
    gatherings of the rich and powerful, and spend evenings in the company of politicians,
    guild leaders, high priests, and nobility. You must also contend with the highest
    levels of deceit and treachery. The wealthier you are, the greater the chance
    you will be drawn into political intrigue as a pawn or participant.
