  Description: You live in inhumane conditions. With no place to call home, you shelter
    wherever you can, sneaking into barns, huddling in old crates, and relying on
    the good graces of people better off than you. A wretched lifestyle presents
    abundant dangers. Violence, disease, and hunger follow you wherever you go. Other
    wretched people covet your armor, weapons, and adventuring gear, which represent
    a fortune by their standards. You are beneath the notice of most people.
