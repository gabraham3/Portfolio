  Description: A poor lifestyle means going without the comforts available in a stable
    community. Simple food and lodgings, threadbare clothing, and unpredictable conditions
    result in a sufficient, though probably unpleasant, experience. Your accommodations
    might be a room in a flophouse or in the common room above a tavern. You benefit
    from some legal protections, but you still have to contend with violence, crime,
    and disease. People at this lifestyle level tend to be unskilled laborers, costermongers,
    peddlers, thieves, mercenaries, and other disreputable types.
