  Description: You live in a leaky stable, a mud-floored hut just outside town, or
    a vermin-infested boarding house in the worst part of town. You have shelter
    from the elements, but you live in a desperate and often violent environment,
    in places rife with disease, hunger, and misfortune. You are beneath the notice
    of most people, and you have few legal protections. Most people at this lifestyle
    level have suffered some terrible setback. They might be disturbed, marked as
    exiles, or suffer from disease.
