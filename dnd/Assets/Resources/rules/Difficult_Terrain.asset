  title: Difficult Terrain
  description: "The travel speeds given in the Travel Pace table assume relatively
    simple terrain: roads, open plains, or clear dungeon corridors. But adventurers
    often face dense forests, deep swamps, rubble-filled ruins, steep mountains,
    and ice-covered ground\u2014all considered difficult terrain.You move at half
    speed in difficult terrain\u2014moving 1 foot in difficult terrain costs 2 feet
    of speed\u2014so you can cover only half the normal distance in a minute, an
    hour, or a day."
