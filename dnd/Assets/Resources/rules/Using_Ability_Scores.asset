    and mental characteristics Strength, measuring physical power Dexterity, measuring
    agility Constitution, measuring endurance Intelligence, measuring reasoning and
    memory Wisdom, measuring perception and insight Charisma, measuring force of
    personality Is a character muscle-bound and insightful? Brilliant and charming?
    Nimble and hardy? Ability scores define these qualities\u2014a creature's assets
    as well as weaknesses. The three main rolls of the game\u2014the ability check,
    the saving throw, and the attack roll\u2014rely on the six ability scores. The
    book's introduction describes the basic rule behind these rolls: roll a d20,
    add an ability modifier derived from one of the six ability scores, and compare
    the total to a target number. This chapter focuses on how to use ability checks
    and saving throws, covering the fundamental activities that creatures attempt
    in the game. Rules for attack rolls appear in chapter 9."
