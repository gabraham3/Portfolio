  title: Making an Attack
  description: Grappling When you want to grab a creature or wrestle with it, you
    can use the Attack action to make a special melee attack, a grapple. If you're
    able to make multiple attacks with the Attack action, this attack replaces one
    of them. The target of your grapple must be no more than one size larger than
    you, and it must be within your reach. Using at least one free hand, you try
    to seize the target by making a grapple check, a Strength (Athletics) check contested
    by the target's Strength (Athletics) or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check (the target
    chooses the ability to use). You succeed automatically if the target is incapacitated.
    If you succeed, you subject the target to the grappled condition (see the appendix).
    The condition specifies the things that end it, and you can release the target
    whenever you like (no action required). Escaping a Grapple A grappled creature
    can use its action to escape. To do so, it must succeed on a Strength (Athletics)
    or Dexterity (Acrobatics) check contested by your Strength (Athletics) check.
    Moving a Grappled Target When you move, you can drag or carry the grappled creature
    with you, but your speed is halved, unless the creature is two or more sizes
    smaller than you.
