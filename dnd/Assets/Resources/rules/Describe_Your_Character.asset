  title: Describe Your Character
  description: "Once you know the basic game aspects of your character, it's time
    to flesh him or her out as a person. Your character needs a name. Spend a few
    minutes thinking about what he or she looks like and how he or she behaves in
    general terms. Using the information in chapter 4, you can flesh out your character's
    physical appearance and personality traits. Choose your character's alignment
    (the moral compass that guides his or her decisions) and ideals. Chapter 4 also
    helps you identify the things your character holds most dear, called bonds, and
    the flaws that could one day undermine him or her. Your character's background
    describes where he or she came from, his or her original occupation, and the
    character's place in the D&D world. Your DM might offer additional backgrounds
    beyond the ones included in chapter 4, and might be willing to work with you
    to craft a background that's a more precise fit for your character concept. A
    background gives your character a background feature (a general benefit) and
    proficiency in two skills, and it might also give you additional languages or
    proficiency with certain kinds of tools. Record this information, along with
    the personality information you develop, on your character sheet. Your Character's
    Abilities Take your character's ability scores and race into account as you flesh
    out his or her appearance and personality. A very strong character with low Intelligence
    might think and behave very differently from a very smart character with low
    Strength. For example, high Strength usually corresponds with a burly or athletic
    body, while a character with low Strength might be scrawny or plump. A character
    with high Dexterity is probably lithe and slim, while a character with low Dexterity
    might be either gangly and awkward or heavy and thick-fingered. A character with
    high Constitution usually looks healthy, with bright eyes and abundant energy.
    A character with low Constitution might be sickly or frail. A character with
    high Intelligence might be highly inquisitive and studious, while a character
    with low Intelligence might speak simply or easily forget details. A character
    with high Wisdom has good judgment, empathy, and a general awareness of what's
    going on. A character with low Wisdom might be absent-minded, foolhardy, or oblivious.
    A character with high Charisma exudes confidence, which is usually mixed with
    a graceful or intimidating presence. A character with a low Charisma might come
    across as abrasive, inarticulate, or timid. Building Bruenor, Step 4 Bob fills
    in some of Bruenor's basic details: his name, his sex (male), his height and
    weight, and his alignment (lawful good). His high Strength and Constitution suggest
    a healthy, athletic body, and his low Intelligence suggests a degree of forgetfulness.
    Bob decides that Bruenor comes from a noble line, but his clan was expelled from
    its homeland when Bruenor was very young. He grew up working as a smith in the
    remote villages of Icewind Dale. But Bruenor has a heroic destiny\u2014to reclaim
    his homeland\u2014so Bob chooses the folk hero background for his dwarf. He notes
    the proficiencies and special feature this background gives him. Bob has a pretty
    clear picture of Bruenor's personality in mind, so he skips the personality traits
    suggested in the folk hero background, noting instead that Bruenor is a caring,
    sensitive dwarf who genuinely loves his friends and allies, but he hides this
    soft heart behind a gruff, snarling demeanor. He chooses the ideal of fairness
    from the list in his background, noting that Bruenor believes that no one is
    above the law. Given his history, Bruenor's bond is obvious: he aspires to someday
    reclaim Mithral Hall, his homeland, from the shadow dragon that drove the dwarves
    out. His flaw is tied to his caring, sensitive nature\u2014he has a soft spot
    for orphans and wayward souls, leading him to show mercy even when it might not
    be warranted."
