  title: Between Adventures
  description: Between trips to dungeons and battles against ancient evils, adventurers
    need time to rest, recuperate, and prepare for their next adventure. Many adventurers
    also use this time to perform other tasks, such as crafting arms and armor, performing
    research, or spending their hard-earned gold.In some cases, the passage of time
    is something that occurs with little fanfare or description. When starting a
    new adventure, the DM might simply declare that a certain amount of time has
    passed and allow you to describe in general terms what your character has been
    doing. At other times, the DM might want to keep track of just how much time
    is passing as events beyond your perception stay in motion.
