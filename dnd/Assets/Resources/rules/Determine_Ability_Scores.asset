  CTitle: Step-by-Step Characters
  title: Determine Ability Scores
  description: 'Much of what your character does in the game depends on his or her
    six abilities: Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma.
    Each ability has a score, which is a number you record on your character sheet.
    The six abilities and their use in the game are described in chapter 7. The Ability
    Score Summary table provides a quick reference for what qualities are measured
    by each ability, what races increases which abilities, and what classes consider
    each ability particularly important. You generate your character''s six ability
    scores randomly. Roll four 6-sided dice and record the total of the highest three
    dice on a piece of scratch paper. Do this five more times, so that you have six
    numbers. If you want to save time or don''t like the idea of randomly determining
    ability scores, you can use the following scores instead: 15, 14, 13, 12, 10,
    8. Now take your six numbers and write each number beside one of your character''s
    six abilities to assign scores to Strength, Dexterity, Constitution, Intelligence,
    Wisdom, and Charisma. Afterward, make any changes to your ability scores as a
    result of your race choice. After assigning your ability scores, determine your
    ability modifiers using the Ability Scores and Modifiers table. To determine
    an ability modifier without consulting the table, subtract 10 from the ability
    score and then divide the result by 2 (round down). Write the modifier next to
    each of your scores. Ability Score Summary Strength Measures: Natural athleticism,
    bodily power Important for: Barbarian, fighter, paladinRaces that have a bonus
    to Strength Ability Score Summary Dexterity Measures: Physical agility, reflexes,
    balance, poise Important for: Monk, ranger, rogue Races that have a bonus to
    Dexterity Ability Score Summary Constitution Measures: Health, stamina, vital
    force Important for: Everyone Races that have a bonus to Constitution Ability
    Score Summary Intelligence Measures: Mental acuity, information recall, analytical
    skill Important for: Wizard Races that have a bonus to Intelligence Ability Score
    Summary Wisdom Measures: Awareness, intuition, insight Important for: Cleric,
    druid Races that have a bonus to Wisdom Ability Score Summary Charisma Measures:
    Confidence, eloquence, leadership Important for: Bard, sorcerer, warlock Races
    that have a bonus to Charisma Building Bruenor, Step 3 Bob decides to use the
    standard set of scores (15, 14, 13, 12, 10, 8) for Bruenor''s abilities. Since
    he''s a fighter, he puts his highest score, 15, in Strength. His next highest,
    14, goes in Constitution. Bruenor might be a brash fighter, but Bob decides he
    wants the dwarf to be older, wiser, and a good leader, so he puts decent scores
    in Wisdom and Charisma. After applying his racial benefits (increasing Bruenor''s
    Constitution by 2 and his Strength by 2), Bruenor''s ability scores and modifiers
    look like this: Strength 17 (+3), Dexterity 10 (+0), Constitution 16 (+3), Intelligence
    8 (-1), Wisdom 13 (+1), Charisma 12 (+1). Bob fills in Bruenor''s final hit points:
    10 + his Constitution modifier of +3, for a total of 13 hit points. Variant:
    Customizing Ability Scores At your Dungeon Master''s option, you can use this
    variant for determining your ability scores. The method described here allows
    you to build a character with a set of ability scores you choose individually.
    You have 27 points to spend on your ability scores. The cost of each score is
    shown on the Ability Score Point Cost table. For example, a score of 14 costs
    7 points. Using this method, 15 is the highest ability score you can end up with,
    before applying racial increases. You can''t have a score lower than 8. This
    method of determining ability scores enables you to create a set of three high
    numbers and three low ones (15, 15, 15, 8, 8, 8), a set of numbers that are above
    average and nearly equal (13, 13, 13, 12, 12, 12), or any set of numbers between
    those extremes.'
