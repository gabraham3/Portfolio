  description: Characters who turn their attention to other tasks as the group travels
    are not focused on watching for danger.These characters don't contribute their
    passive Wisdom (Perception) scores to the group's chance of noticing hidden threats.
    However, a character not watching for danger can do one of the following activities
    instead, or some other activity with the DM's permission.Navigate. The character
    can try to prevent the group from becoming lost, making a Wisdom (Survival) check
    when the DM calls for it. (The Dungeon Master's Guide has rules to determine
    whether the group gets lost.)Draw a Map. The character can draw a map that records
    the group's progress and helps the characters get back on course if they get
    lost. No ability check is required.Track. A character can follow the tracks of
    another creature, making a Wisdom (Survival) check when the DM calls for it.
    (The Dungeon Master's Guide has rules for tracking.)Forage. The character can
    keep an eye out for ready sources of food and water, making a Wisdom (Survival)
    check when the DM calls for it. (The Dungeon Master's Guide has rules for foraging.)
