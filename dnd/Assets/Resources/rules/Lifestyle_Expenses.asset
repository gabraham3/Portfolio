  title: Lifestyle Expenses
  description: Between adventures, you choose a particular quality of life and pay
    the cost of maintaining that lifestyle, as described in chapter 5.Living a particular
    lifestyle doesn't have a huge effect on your character, but your lifestyle can
    affect the way other individuals and groups react to you. For example, when you
    lead an aristocratic lifestyle, it might be easier for you to influence the nobles
    of the city than if you live in poverty.
