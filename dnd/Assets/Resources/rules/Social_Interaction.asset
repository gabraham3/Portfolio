  title: Social Interaction
  description: 'Exploring dungeons, overcoming obstacles, and slaying monsters are
    key parts of D&D adventures. No less important, though, are the social interactions
    that adventurers have with other inhabitants of the world.Interaction takes on
    many forms. You might need to convince an unscrupulous thief to confess to some
    malfeasance, or you might try to flatter a dragon so that it will spare your
    life. The DM assumes the roles of any characters who are participating in the
    interaction that don''t belong to another player at the table. Any such character
    is called a nonplayer character (NPC).In general terms, an NPC''s attitude toward
    you is described as friendly, indifferent, or hostile. Friendly NPCs are predisposed
    to help you, and hostile ones are inclined to get in your way. It''s easier to
    get what you want from a friendly NPC, of course.Social interactions have two
    primary aspects: roleplaying and ability checks.'
