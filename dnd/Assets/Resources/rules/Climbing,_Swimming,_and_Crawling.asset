  title: Climbing, Swimming, and Crawling
  description: Each foot of movement costs 1 extra foot (2 extra feet in difficult
    terrain) when you're climbing, swimming, or crawling. You ignore this extra cost
    if you have a climbing speed and use it to climb, or a swimming speed and use
    it to swim. At the DM's option, climbing a slippery vertical surface or one with
    few handholds requires a successful Strength (Athletics) check. Similarly, gaining
    any distance in rough water might require a successful Strength (Athletics) check.
