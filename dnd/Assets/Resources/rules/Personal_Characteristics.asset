  title: Personal Characteristics
  description: "Fleshing out your character's personality\u2014the array of traits,
    mannerisms, habits, beliefs, and flaws that give a person a unique identity\u2014will
    help you bring him or her to life as you play the game. Four categories of characteristics
    are presented here: personality traits, ideals, bonds, and flaws. Beyond those
    categories, think about your character's favorite words or phrases, tics and
    habitual gestures, vices and pet peeves, and whatever else you can imagine. Each
    background presented later in this chapter includes suggested characteristics
    that you can use to spark your imagination. You're not bound to those options,
    but they're a good starting point. Personality Traits Give your character two
    personality traits. Personality traits are small, simple ways to help you set
    your character apart from every other character. Your personality traits should
    tell you something interesting and fun about your character. They should be self
    descriptions that are specific about what makes your character stand out. 'I'm
    smart' is not a good trait, because it describes a lot of characters. 'I've read
    every book in Candlekeep' tells you something specific about your character's
    interests and disposition. Personality traits might describe the things your
    character likes, his or her past accomplishments, things your character dislikes
    or fears, your character's self attitude or mannerisms, or the influence of his
    or her ability scores. A useful place to start thinking about personality traits
    is to look at your highest and lowest ability scores and define one trait related
    to each. Either one could be positive or negative: you might work hard to overcome
    a low score, for example, or be cocky about your high score. Ideals Describe
    one ideal that drives your character. Your ideals are the things that you believe
    in most strongly, the fundamental moral and ethical principles that compel you
    to act as you do. Ideals encompass everything from your life goals to your core
    belief system. Ideals might answer any of these questions: What are the principles
    that you will never betray? What would prompt you to make sacrifices? What drives
    you to act and guides your goals and ambitions? What is the single most important
    thing you strive for? You can choose any ideals you like, but your character's
    alignment is a good place to start defining them. Each background in this chapter
    includes six suggested ideals. Five of them are linked to aspects of alignment:
    law, chaos, good, evil, and neutrality. The last one has more to do with the
    particular background than with moral or ethical perspectives. Bonds Create one
    bond for your character. Bonds represent a character's connections to people,
    places, and events in the world. They tie you to things from your background.
    They might inspire you to heights of heroism, or lead you to act against your
    own best interests if they are threatened. They can work very much like ideals,
    driving a character's motivations and goals. Bonds might answer any of these
    questions: Whom do you care most about? To what place do you feel a special connection?
    What is your most treasured possession? Your bonds might be tied to your class,
    your background, your race, or some other aspect of your character's history
    or personality. You might also gain new bonds over the course of your adventures.
    Flaws Finally, choose a flaw for your character. Your character's flaw represents
    some vice, compulsion, fear, or weakness\u2014in particular, anything that someone
    else could exploit to bring you to ruin or cause you to act against your best
    interests. More significant than negative personality traits, a flaw might answer
    any of these questions: What enrages you? What's the one person, concept, or
    event that you are terrified of? What are your vices? Tika and Artemis: Personal
    Characteristics Tika and Artemis have distinct personality traits. Tika Waylan
    dislikes boastfulness and has a fear of heights resulting from a bad fall during
    her career as a thief. Artemis Entreri is always prepared for the worst and moves
    with quick, precise confidence. Consider their ideals. Tika Waylan is innocent,
    almost childlike, believing in the value of life and the importance of appreciating
    everyone. Neutral good in alignment, she cleaves to ideals of life and respect.
    Artemis Entreri never allows his emotions to master him, and he constantly challenges
    himself to improve his skills. His lawful evil alignment gives him ideals of
    impartiality and a lust for power. Tika Waylan's bond is to the Inn of the Last
    Home. The inn's proprietor gave her a new chance at life, and her friendship
    with her adventuring companions was forged during her time working there. Its
    destruction by the marauding dragonarmies gives Tika a very personal reason to
    hate them with a fiery passion. Her bond might be phrased 'I will do whatever
    it takes to punish the dragonarmies for the destruction of the Inn of the Last
    Home.'Artemis Entreri's bond is a strange, almost paradoxical relationship with
    Drizzt Do'Urden, his equal in swordplay and grim determination. In his first
    battle with Drizzt, Artemis recognized something of himself in his opponent,
    some indication that if his life had gone differently, might have led a life
    more like the heroic drow's. From that moment, Artemis is more than a criminal
    assassin\u2014he is an antihero, driven by his rivalry with Drizzt. His bond
    might be phrased as 'I will not rest until I have proved myself better than Drizzt
    Do'Urden.'Each of these characters also has an important flaw. Tika Waylan is
    naive and emotionally vulnerable, younger than her companions and annoyed that
    they still think of her as the kid they knew years ago. She might even be tempted
    to act against her principles if she's convinced that a particular achievement
    would demonstrate her maturity. Artemis Entreri is completely walled off from
    any personal relationship and just wants to be left alone."
