  description: 'The marketplace of a large city teems with buyers and sellers of
    many sorts: dwarf smiths and elf woodcarvers, halfling farmers and gnome jewelers,
    not to mention humans of every shape, size, and color drawn from a spectrum of
    nations and cultures. In the largest cities, almost anything imaginable is offered
    for sale, from exotic spices and luxurious clothing to wicker baskets and practical
    swords. For an adventurer, the availability of armor, weapons, backpacks, rope,
    and similar goods is of paramount importance, since proper equipment can mean
    the difference between life and death in a dungeon or the untamed wilds. This
    chapter details the mundane and exotic merchandise that adventurers commonly
    find useful in the face of the threats that the worlds of D&D present.'
