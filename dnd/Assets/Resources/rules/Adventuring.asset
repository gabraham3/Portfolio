  description: "Delving into the ancient tomb of horrors, slipping through the back
    alleys of Waterdeep, hacking a fresh trail through the thick jungles on the Isle
    of Dread\u2014these are the things that Dungeons & Dragons adventures are made
    of. Your character in the game might explore forgotten ruins and uncharted lands,
    uncover dark secrets and sinister plots, and slay foul monsters. And if all goes
    well, your character will survive to claim rich rewards before embarking on a
    new adventure.This chapter covers the basics of the adventuring life, from the
    mechanics of movement to the complexities of social interaction. The rules for
    resting are also in this chapter, along with a discussion of the activities your
    character might pursue between adventures.Whether adventurers are exploring a
    dusty dungeon or the complex relationships of a royal court, the game follows
    a natural rhythm, as outlined in the book's introduction:1. The DM describes
    the environment.2. The players describe what they want to do.3. The DM narrates
    the results of their actions.Typically, the DM uses a map as an outline of the
    adventure, tracking the characters' progress as they explore dungeon corridors
    or wilderness regions.The DM's notes, including a key to the map, describe what
    the adventurers find as they enter each new area. Sometimes, the passage of time
    and the adventurers' actions determine what happens, so the DM might use a time
    line or a flowchart to track their progress instead of a map."
