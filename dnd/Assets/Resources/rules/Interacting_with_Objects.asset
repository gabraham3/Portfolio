  title: Interacting with Objects
  description: A character's interaction with objects in an environment is often
    simple to resolve in the game. The player tells the DM that his or her character
    is doing something, such a moving a lever, and the DM describes what, if anything
    happens.For example, a character might decide to pull a lever, which might, in
    turn, raise a portcullis, cause a room to flood with water, or open a secret
    door in a nearby wall. If the lever is rusted in position, though, a character
    might need to force it. In such a situation, the DM might call for a Strength
    check to see whether the character can wrench the lever into place. The DM sets
    the DC for any such check based on the difficulty of the task.Characters can
    also damage objects with their weapons and spells. Objects are immune to poison
    and psychic damage, but otherwise they can be affected by physical and magical
    attacks much like creatures can. The DM determines an object's Armor Class and
    hit points, and might decide that certain objects have resistance or immunity
    to certain kinds of attacks. (It's hard to cut a rope with a club, for example.)
    Objects always fail Strength and Dexterity saving throws, and they are immune
    to effects that require other saves.When an object drops to 0 hit points, it
    breaks.A character can also attempt a Strength check to break an object. The
    DM sets the DC for any such check
  score: 0
