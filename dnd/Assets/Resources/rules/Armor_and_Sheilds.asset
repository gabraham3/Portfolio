  title: Armor and Sheilds
  description: 'D&D worlds are a vast tapestry made up of many different cultures,
    each with its own technology level. For this reason, adventurers have access
    to a variety of armor types, ranging from leather armor to chain mail to costly
    plate armor, with several other kinds of armor in between. The Armor table collects
    the most commonly available types of armor found in the game and separates them
    into three categories: light armor, medium armor, and heavy armor. Many warriors
    supplement their armor with a shield. The Armor table shows the cost, weight,
    and other properties of the common types of armor worn in the worlds of D&D.
    Armor Proficiency. Anyone can put on a suit of armor or strap a shield to an
    arm. Only those proficient in the armor''s use know how to wear it effectively,
    however. Your class gives you proficiency with certain types of armor. If you
    wear armor that you lack proficiency with, you have disadvantage on any ability
    check, saving throw, or attack roll that involves Strength or Dexterity, and
    you can''t cast spells. Armor Class (AC). Armor protects its wearer from attacks.
    The armor (and shield) you wear determines your base Armor Class. Heavy Armor.
    Heavier armor interferes with the wearer''s ability to move quickly, stealthily,
    and freely. If the Armor table shows Str 13 or Str 15 in the Strength column
    for an armor type, the armor reduces the wearer''s speed by 10 feet unless the
    wearer has a Strength score equal to or higher than the listed score. Stealth.
    If the Armor table shows Disadvantage in the Stealth column, the wearer has disadvantage
    on Dexterity (Stealth) checks. Shields. A shield is made from wood or metal and
    is carried in one hand. Wielding a shield increases your Armor Class by 2. You
    can benefit from only one shield at a time. Variant: Equipment Sizes In most
    campaigns, you can use or wear any equipment that you find on your adventures,
    within the bounds of common sense. For example, a burly half-orc won''t fit in
    a halfling''s leather armor, and a gnome would be swallowed up in a cloud giant''s
    elegant robe. The DM can impose more realism. For example, a suit of plate armor
    made for one human might not fit another one without significant alterations,
    and a guard''s uniform might be visibly ill-fitting when an adventurer tries
    to wear it as a disguise. Using this variant, when adventurers find armor, clothing,
    and similar items that are made to be worn, they might need to visit an armorsmith,
    tailor, leatherworker, or similar expert to make the item wearable. The cost
    for such work varies from 10 to 40 percent of the market price of the item. The
    DM can either roll 1d4 x 10 or determine the increase in cost based on the extent
    of the alterations required. Light Armor Made from supple and thin materials,
    light armor favors agile adventurers since it offers some protection without
    sacrificing mobility. If you wear light armor, you add your Dexterity modifier
    to the base number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class. Padded.
    Padded armor consists of quilted layers of cloth and batting. Leather. The breastplate
    and shoulder protectors of this armor are made of leather that has been stiffened
    by being boiled in oil. The rest of the armor is made of softer and more flexible
    materials. Studded Leather. Made from tough but flexible leather, studded leather
    is reinforced with close-set rivets or spikes. Medium Armor Medium armor offers
    more protection than light armor, but it also impairs movement more. If you wear
    medium armor, you add your Dexterity modifier, to a maximum of +2, to the base
    number from your armor type to determine your Armor Class. Hide. This crude armor
    consists of thick furs and pelts. It is commonly worn by barbarian tribes, evil
    humanoids, and other folk who lack access to the tools and materials needed to
    create better armor. Chain Shirt. Made of interlocking metal rings, a chain shirt
    is worn between layers of clothing or leather. This armor offers modest protection
    to the wearer''s upper body and allows the sound of the rings rubbing against
    one another to be muffled by outer layers. Scale Mail. This armor consists of
    a coat and leggings (and perhaps a separate skirt) of leather covered with overlapping
    pieces of metal, much like the scales of a fish. The suit includes gauntlets.
    Breastplate. This armor consists of a fitted metal chest piece worn with supple
    leather. Although it leaves the legs and arms relatively unprotected, this armor
    provides good protection for the wearer''s vital organs while leaving the wearer
    relatively unencumbered. Half Plate. Half plate consists of shaped metal plates
    that cover most of the wearer''s body. It does not include leg protection beyond
    simple greaves that are attached with leather straps. Heavy Armor Of all the
    armor categories, heavy armor offers the best protection. These suits of armor
    cover the entire body and are designed to stop a wide range of attacks. Only
    proficient warriors can manage their weight and bulk. Heavy armor doesn''t let
    you add your Dexterity modifier to your Armor Class, but it also doesn''t penalize
    you if your Dexterity modifier is negative. Ring Mail. This armor is leather
    armor with heavy rings sewn into it. The rings help reinforce the armor against
    blows from swords and axes. Ring mail is inferior to chain mail, and it''s usually
    worn only by those who can''t afford better armor. Chain Mail. Made of interlocking
    metal rings, chain mail includes a layer of quilted fabric worn underneath the
    mail to prevent chafing and to cushion the impact of blows. The suit includes
    gauntlets. Splint. This armor is made of narrow vertical strips of metal riveted
    to a backing of leather that is worn over cloth padding. Flexible chain mail
    protects the joints. Plate. Plate consists of shaped, interlocking metal plates
    to cover the entire body. A suit of plate includes gauntlets, heavy leather boots,
    a visored helmet, and thick layers of padding underneath the armor. Buckles and
    straps distribute the weight over the body. Getting Into and Out of Armor The
    time it takes to don or doff armor depends on the armor''s category. Don. This
    is the time it takes to put on armor. You benefit from the armor''s AC only if
    you take the full time to don the suit of armor. Doff. This is the time it takes
    to take off armor. If you have help, reduce this time by half. Donning and Doffing
