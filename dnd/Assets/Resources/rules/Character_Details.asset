  description: "Your character's name and physical description might be the first
    things that the other players at the table learn about you. It's worth thinking
    about how these characteristics reflect the character you have in mind. Name
    Your character's race description includes sample names for members of that race.
    Put some thought into your name even if you're just picking one from a list.
    Sex You can play a male or female character without gaining any special benefits
    or hindrances. Think about how your character does or does not conform to the
    broader culture's expectations of sex, gender, and sexual behavior. For example,
    a male drow cleric defies the traditional gender divisions of drow society, which
    could be a reason for your character to leave society and come to the surface.
    You don't need to be confined to binary notions of sex and gender. The elf god
    Corellon Larethian is often seen as androgynous or hermaphroditic, for example,
    and some elves in the multiverse are made in Corellon's image. You could also
    play a female character who presents herself as a man, a man who feels trapped
    in a female body, or a bearded female dwarf who hates being mistaken for a male.
    Likewise, your character's sexual orientation is for you to decide. Tika and
    Artemis: Contrasting Characters The details in this chapter make a big difference
    in setting your character apart from every other character. Consider the following
    two human fighters. Hailing from the Dragonlance setting, Tika Waylan was a brash
    teenager who had a rough childhood. The daughter of a thief, she ran away from
    home and practiced her father's trade on the streets of Solace. When she tried
    to rob the proprietor of the Inn of the Last Home, he caught her and took her
    under his wing, giving her a job as a barmaid. But when the dragon armies laid
    waste to the town of Solace and destroyed the inn, necessity forced Tika into
    adventure alongside the friends she'd known from her childhood. Her skill as
    a fighter (a frying pan remains one of her favorite weapons) combined with her
    history on the streets gave her skills invaluable in her adventuring career.
    Artemis Entreri grew up on the streets of Cailmport in the Forgotten Realms.
    He used his wits, strength, and agility to carve out his own territory in one
    of the city's hundreds of poor shanty towns. After several years, he attracted
    the notice of one of the most powerful thieves' guilds in the city, and he ascended
    the ranks of the guild quickly despite his youth. Artemis became the favored
    assassin of one of the city's pashas, who sent him to far-off Icewind Dale to
    recover some stolen gems. He's a professional killer, constantly challenging
    himself to improve his skills. Tika and Artemis are both human and both fighters
    (with some experience as rogues), possessing similarly high Strength and Dexterity
    scores, but there the similarity ends. Height and Weight You can decide your
    character's height and weight, using the information provided in your race description
    or on the Random Height and Weight table. Think about what your character's ability
    scores might say about his or her height and weight. A weak but agile character
    might be thin. A strong and tough character might be tall or just heavy. If you
    want to, you can roll randomly for your character's height and weight using the
    Random Height and Weight table. The dice roll given in the Height Modifier column
    determines the character's extra height (in inches) beyond the base height. That
    same number multiplied by the dice roll or quantity given in the Weight Modifier
    column determines the character's extra weight (in pounds) beyond the base weight.
    For example, as a human, Tika has a height of 4 feet 8 inches plus 2d10 inches.
    Her player rolls 2d10 and gets a total of 12, so Tika stands 5 feet 8 inches
    tall. Then the player uses that same roll of 12 and multiplies it by 2d4 pounds.
    Her 2d4 roll is 3, so Tika weighs an extra 36 pounds (12 x 3) on top of her base
    110 pounds, for a total of 146 pounds. Other Physical Characteristics You choose
    your character's age and the color of his or her hair, eyes, and skin. To add
    a touch of distinctiveness, you might want to give your character an unusual
    or memorable physical characteristic, such as a scar, a limp, or a tattoo. Tika
    and Artemis: Character Details Consider how the names Tika Waylan and Artemis
    Entreri set these characters apart from each other and reflect their personalities.
    Tika is a young woman determined to prove that she's not just a kid any more,
    and her name makes her sound young and ordinary. Artemis Entreri comes from an
    exotic land and carries a more mysterious name. Tika is nineteen years old at
    the start of her adventuring career and has auburn hair, green eyes, fair skin
    with freckles, and a mole on her right hip. Artemis is a small man, compact and
    all wiry muscle. He has angular features and high cheekbones, and he always seems
    in need of a shave. His raven black hair is thick and full, but his eyes are
    gray and lifeless\u2014betraying the emptiness of his life and soul. Alignment
    A typical creature in the worlds of Dungeons & Dragons has an alignment, which
    broadly describes its moral and personal attitudes. Alignment is a combination
    of two factors: one identifies morality (good, evil, or neutral), and the other
    describes attitudes toward society and order (lawful, chaotic, or neutral). Thus,
    nine distinct alignments define the possible combinations. These brief summaries
    of the nine alignments describe the typical behavior of a creature with that
    alignment. Individuals might vary significantly from that typical behavior, and
    few people are perfectly and consistently faithful to the precepts of their alignment.
    Lawful good (LG) creatures can be counted on to do the right thing as expected
    by society. Gold dragons and paladins are typically lawful good. Neutral good
    (NG) folk do the best they can to help others according to their needs. Many
    celestials are neutral good. Chaotic good (CG) creatures act as their conscience
    directs, with little regard for what others expect. Copper dragons and unicorns
    are typically chaotic good. Lawful neutral (LN) individuals act in accordance
    with law, tradition, or personal codes. Modrons and many wizards and monks are
    lawful neutral. Neutral (N) is the alignment of those who prefer to steer clear
    of moral questions and don't take sides, doing what seems best at the time. Druids
    are traditionally neutral, as are typical townsfolk. Chaotic neutral (CN) creatures
    follow their whims, holding their personal freedom above all else. Many rogues
    and bards are chaotic neutral. Lawful evil (LE) creatures methodically take what
    they want, within the limits of a code of tradition, loyalty, or order. Devils
    and blue dragons are typically lawful evil. Neutral evil (NE) is the alignment
    of those who do whatever they can get away with, without compassion or qualms.
    Yugoloths are typically neutral evil. Chaotic evil (CE) creatures act with arbitrary
    violence, spurred by their greed, hatred, or bloodlust. Demons and red dragons
    are typically chaotic evil. Alignment in the Multiverse For many thinking creatures,
    alignment is a moral choice. Humans, dwarves, elves, and other people can choose
    whether to follow the paths of good or evil, law or chaos. According to myth,
    the gods who created these folk gave them free will to choose their moral paths.
    Alignment is an essential part of the nature of celestials and fiends. Both types
    of creatures are associated with metaphysical planes of existence\u2014specifically
    the Outer Planes\u2014that embody certain alignments. For example, most devils
    hail from the Nine Hells, a plane of lawful evil. A devil does not choose to
    be lawful evil or tend toward lawful evil, but rather it is lawful evil in its
    essence. If it somehow ceases to be lawful evil, it changes into something new\u2014a
    transformation worthy of legend. Generally, evil alignments are for villains
    and monsters. A devil does not choose to be lawful evil, and it doesn't tend
    toward lawful evil, but rather it is lawful evil in its essence. If it somehow
    ceased to be lawful evil, it would cease to be a devil. Most creatures that lack
    the capacity for rational thought do not have alignments\u2014they are unaligned.
    Such a creature is incapable of making a moral or ethical choice and acts according
    to its bestial nature. Sharks are savage predators, for example, but they are
    not evil; they have no alignment. Tika and Artemis: Alignment Tika Waylan is
    neutral good, fundamentally good-hearted and striving to help others where she
    can. Artemis is lawful evil, unconcerned with the value of sentient life but
    at least professional in his approach to murder. As an evil character, Artemis
    is not an ideal adventurer. He began his career as a villain, and only cooperates
    with heroes when he must\u2014and when it's in his own best interests. In most
    games, evil adventurers cause problems in groups alongside others who don't share
    their interests and objectives. Languages Your race indicates the languages your
    character can speak by default, and your background might give you access to
    one or more additional languages of your choice. Note these languages on your
    character sheet. With your DM's permission, you can instead choose a language
    from the Exotic Languages table or a secret language, such as thieves' cant or
    the tongue of druids. Some of these languages are actually families of languages
    with many dialects. For example, the Primordial language includes the Auran,
    Aquan, Ignan, and Terran dialects, one for each of the four elemental planes.
    Creatures that speak different dialects of the same language can communicate
    with one another."
