  CTitle: Step-by-Step Characters
  title: Choose a Race
  description: 'Every character belongs to a race, one of the many intelligent humanoid
    species in the D&D world. The most common player character races are dwarves,
    elves, halflings, and humans. Some races also have subraces, such as mountain
    dwarf or wood elf. Chapter 2 provides more information about these races. The
    race you choose contributes to your character''s identity in an important way,
    by establishing a general appearance and the natural talents gained from culture
    and ancestry. Your character''s race grants particular racial traits, such as
    special senses, proficiency with certain weapons or tools, proficiency in one
    or more skills, or the ability to use minor spells. These traits sometimes dovetail
    with the capabilities of certain classes (see step 2). For example, the racial
    traits of lightfoot halflings make them exceptional rogues, and high elves tend
    to be powerful wizards. Sometimes playing against type can be fun, too. Halfling
    paladins and mountain dwarf wizards, for example, can be unusual but memorable
    characters. Your race also increases one or more of your ability scores, which
    you determine in step 3. Note these increases and remember to apply them later.
    Record the traits granted by your race on your character sheet. Be sure to note
    your starting languages and your base speed as well. Building Bruenor, Step 1
    Bob is sitting down to create his character. He decides that a gruff mountain
    dwarf fits the character he wants to play. He notes all the racial traits of
    dwarves on his character sheet, including his speed of 25 feet and the languages
    he knows: Common and Dwarvish.'
