  title: Saving Throws
  description: "A saving throw\u2014also called a save\u2014represents an attempt
    to resist a spell, a trap, a poison, a disease, or a similar threat. You don't
    normally decide to make a saving throw; you are forced to make one because your
    character or monster is at risk of harm. To make a saving throw, roll a d20 and
    add the appropriate ability modifier. For example, you use your Dexterity modifier
    for a Dexterity saving throw. A saving throw can be modified by a situational
    bonus or penalty and can be affected by advantage and disadvantage, as determined
    by the DM. Each class gives proficiency in at least two saving throws. The wizard,
    for example, is proficient in Intelligence saves. As with skill proficiencies,
    proficiency in a saving throw lets a character add his or her proficiency bonus
    to saving throws made using a particular ability score. Some monsters have saving
    throw proficiencies as well. The Difficulty Class for a saving throw is determined
    by the effect that causes it. For example, the DC for a saving throw allowed
    by a spell is determined by the caster's spellcasting ability and proficiency
    bonus. The result of a successful or failed saving throw is also detailed in
    the effect that allows the save. Usually, a successful save means that a creature
    suffers no harm, or reduced harm, from an effect."
