  description: Temporary Hit Points Some spells and special abilities confer temporary
    hit points to a creature. Temporary hit points aren't actual hit points; they
    are a buffer against damage, a pool of hit points that protect you from injury.
    When you have temporary hit points and take damage, the temporary hit points
    are lost first, and any leftover damage carries over to your normal hit points.
    For example, if you have 5 temporary hit points and take 7 damage, you lose the
    temporary hit points and then take 2 damage. Because temporary hit points are
    separate from your actual hit points, they can exceed your hit point maximum.
    A character can, therefore, be at full hit points and receive temporary hit points.
    Healing can't restore temporary hit points, and they can't be added together.
    If you have temporary hit points and receive more of them, you decide whether
    to keep the ones you have or to gain the new ones. For example, if a spell grants
    you 12 temporary hit points when you already have 10, you can have 12 or 10,
    not 22. If you have 0 hit points, receiving temporary hit points doesn't restore
    you to consciousness or stabilize you. They can still absorb damage directed
    at you while you're in that state, but only true healing can save you. Unless
    a feature that grants you temporary hit points has a duration, they last until
    they're depleted or you finish a long rest.
