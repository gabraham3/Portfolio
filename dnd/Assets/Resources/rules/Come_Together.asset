  title: Come Together
  description: Most D&D characters don't work alone. Each character plays a role
    within a party, a group of adventurers working together for a common purpose.
    Teamwork and cooperation greatly improve your party's chances to survive the
    many perils in the worlds of Dungeons & Dragons. Talk to your fellow players
    and your DM to decide whether your characters know one another, how they met,
    and what sorts of quests the group might undertake.
