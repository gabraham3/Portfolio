  title: Jumping
  description: "Your Strength determines how far you can jump.Long Jump. When you
    make a long jump, you cover a number of feet up to your Strength score if you
    move at least 10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing
    long jump, you can leap only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear
    on the jump costs a foot of movement.This rule assumes that the height of your
    jump doesn't matter, such as a jump across a stream or chasm. At your DM's option,
    you must succeed on a DC 10 Strength (Athletics) check to clear a low obstacle
    (no taller than a quarter of the jump's distance), such as a hedge or low wall.
    Otherwise, you hit it.When you land in difficult terrain, you must succeed on
    a DC 10 Dexterity (Acrobatics) check to land on your feet. Otherwise, you land
    prone.High Jump. When you make a high jump, you leap into the air a number of
    feet equal to 3 + your Strength modifier (minimum of 0 feet) if you move at least
    10 feet on foot immediately before the jump. When you make a standing high jump,
    you can jump only half that distance. Either way, each foot you clear on the
    jump costs a foot of movement. In some circumstances, your DM might allow you
    to make a Strength (Athletics) check to jump higher than you normally can.You
    can extend your arms half your height above yourself during the jump. Thus, you
    can reach above you a distance equal to the height of the jump plus 1\xBD times
    your height."
