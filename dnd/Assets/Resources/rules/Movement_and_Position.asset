  description: "Squeezing into a Smaller Space A creature can squeeze through a space
    that is large enough for a creature one size smaller than it. Thus, a Large creature
    can squeeze through a passage that's only 5 feet wide. While squeezing through
    a space, a creature must spend 1 extra foot for every foot it moves there, and
    it has disadvantage on attack rolls and Dexterity saving throws. Attack rolls
    against the creature have advantage while it's in the smaller space. Variant:
    Playing on a Grid If you play out a combat using a square grid and miniatures
    or other tokens, follow these rules. Squares. Each square on the grid represents
    5 feet. Speed. Rather than moving foot by foot, move square by square on the
    grid. This means you use your speed in 5-foot segments. This is particularly
    easy if you translate your speed into squares by dividing the speed by 5. For
    example, a speed of 30 feet translates into a speed of 6 squares. If you use
    a grid often, consider writing your speed in squares on your character sheet.
    Entering a Square. To enter a square, you must have at least 1 square of movement
    left, even if the square is diagonally adjacent to the square you're in. (The
    rule for diagonal movement sacrifices realism for the sake of smooth play. The
    Dungeon Master's Guide provides guidance on using a more realistic approach.)
    If a square costs extra movement, as a square of difficult terrain does, you
    must have enough movement left to pay for entering it. For example, you must
    have at least 2 squares of movement left to enter a square of difficult terrain.
    Corners. Diagonal movement can't cross the corner of a wall, large tree, or other
    terrain feature that fills its space. Ranges. To determine the range on a grid
    between two things\u2014whether creatures or objects\u2014start counting squares
    from a square adjacent to one of them and stop counting in the space of the other
    one. Count by the shortest route."
