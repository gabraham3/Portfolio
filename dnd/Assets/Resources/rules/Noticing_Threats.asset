  title: Noticing Threats
  description: use the passive Wisdom (Perception) scores of the characters to determine
    whether anyone in the group notices a hidden threat. The DM might decide that
    a threat can be noticed only by characters in a particular rank. For example,
    as the characters are exploring a maze of tunnels, the DM might decide that only
    those characters in the back rank have a chance to hear or spot a stealthy creature
    following the group, while characters in the front and middle ranks cannot.While
    traveling at a fast pace, characters take a -5 penalty to their passive Wisdom
    (Perception) scores to notice hidden threats.Encountering Creatures. If the DM
    determines that the adventurers encounter other creatures while they're traveling,
    it's up to both groups to decide what happens next. Either group might decide
    to attack, initiate a conversation, run away, or wait to see what the other group
    does.Surprising Foes. If the adventurers encounter a hostile creature or group,
    the DM determines whether the adventurers or their foes might be surprised when
    combat erupts. See chapter 9 for more about surprise.
