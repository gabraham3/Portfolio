  CTitle: Using Ability Scores
  title: Ability Scores and Modifiers
  description: Each of a creature's abilities has a score, a number that defines
    the magnitude of that ability. An ability score is not just a measure of innate
    capabilities, but also encompasses a creature's training and competence in activities
    related to that ability. A score of 10 or 11 is the normal human average, but
    adventurers and many monsters are a cut above average in most abilities. A score
    of 18 is the highest that a person usually reaches. Adventurers can have scores
    as high as 20, and monsters and divine beings can have scores as high as 30.
    Each ability also has a modifier, derived from the score and ranging from -5
    (for an ability score of 1) to +10 (for a score of 30). The Ability Scores and
    Modifiers table notes the ability modifiers for the range of possible ability
    scores, from 1 to 30. To determine an ability modifier without consulting the
    table, subtract 10 from the ability score and then divide the total by 2 (round
    down). Because ability modifiers affect almost every attack roll, ability check,
    and saving throw, ability modifiers come up in play more often than their associated
    scores.
