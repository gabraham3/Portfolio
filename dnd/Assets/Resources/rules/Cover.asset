  title: Cover
  description: Cover Walls, trees, creatures, and other obstacles can provide cover
    during combat, making a target more difficult to harm. A target can benefit from
    cover only when an attack or other effect originates on the opposite side of
    the cover. There are three degrees of cover. If a target is behind multiple sources
    of cover, only the most protective degree of cover applies; the degrees aren't
    added together. For example, if a target is behind a creature that gives half
    cover and a tree trunk that gives three-quarters cover, the target has three-quarters
    cover. A target with half cover has a +2 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws.
    A target has half cover if an obstacle blocks at least half of its body. The
    obstacle might be a low wall, a large piece of furniture, a narrow tree trunk,
    or a creature, whether that creature is an enemy or a friend. A target with three-quarters
    cover has a +5 bonus to AC and Dexterity saving throws. A target has three-quarters
    cover if about three-quarters of it is covered by an obstacle. The obstacle might
    be a portcullis, an arrow slit, or a thick tree trunk. A target with total cover
    can't be targeted directly by an attack or a spell, although some spells can
    reach such a target by including it in an area of effect. A target has total
    cover if it is completely concealed by an obstacle.
