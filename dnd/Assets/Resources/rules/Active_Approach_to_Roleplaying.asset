  title: Active Approach to Roleplaying
  description: If descriptive roleplaying tells your DM and your fellow players what
    your character thinks and does, active roleplaying shows them.When you use active
    roleplaying, you speak with your character's voice, like an actor taking on a
    role. You might even echo your character's movements and body language. This
    approach is more immersive than descriptive roleplaying, though you still need
    to describe things that can't be reasonably acted out.Going back to the example
    of Chris roleplaying Tordek above, here's how the scene might play out if Chris
    used active roleplaying:Speaking as Tordek, Chris says in a gruff, deep voice,
    'I was wondering why it suddenly smelled awful in here. If I wanted to hear anything
    out of you, I'd snap your arm and enjoy your screams.' In his normal voice, Chris
    then adds, 'I get up, glare at the elf, and head to the bar.
