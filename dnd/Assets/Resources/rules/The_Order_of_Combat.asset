  description: Reactions Certain special abilities, spells, and situations allow
    you to take a special action called a reaction. A reaction is an instant response
    to a trigger of some kind, which can occur on your turn or on someone else's.
    The opportunity attack, described later in this chapter, is the most common type
    of reaction. When you take a reaction, you can't take another one until the start
    of your next turn. If the reaction interrupts another creature's turn, that creature
    can continue its turn right after the reaction.
