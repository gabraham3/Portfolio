  description: "A long rest is a period of extended downtime, at least 8 hours long,
    during which a character sleeps for at least 6 hours and performs no more than
    2 hours of light activity, such as reading, talking, eating, or standing watch.
    If the rest is interrupted by a period of strenuous activity\u2014at least 1
    hour of walking, fighting, casting spells, or similar adventuring activity\u2014the
    characters must begin the rest again to gain any benefit from it.At the end of
    a long rest, a character regains all lost hit points. The character also regains
    spent Hit Dice, up to a number of dice equal to half of the character's total
    number of them. You regain at least 1 Hit Die when you finish a long rest.For
    example, if a character has eight Hit Dice, he or she can regain four spent Hit
    Dice upon finishing a long rest.A character can't benefit from more than one
    long rest in a 24-hour period, and a character must have at least 1 hit point
    at the start of the rest to gain its benefits."
