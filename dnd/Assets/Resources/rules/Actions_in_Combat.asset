  title: Actions in Combat
  description: Actions in Combat When you take your action on your turn, you can
    take one of the actions presented here, an action you gained from your class
    or a special feature, or an action that you improvise. Many monsters have action
    options of their own in their stat blocks. When you describe an action not detailed
    elsewhere in the rules, the DM tells you whether that action is possible and
    what kind of roll you need to make, if any, to determine success or failure.
    Attack, Cast a Spell, Dash, Disengage, Dodge, Help, Hide, Ready, Search, Use
