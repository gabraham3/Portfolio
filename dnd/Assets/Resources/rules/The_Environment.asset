  title: The Environment
  description: By its nature, adventuring involves delving into places that are dark,
    dangerous, and full of mysteries to be explored. The rules in this section cover
    some of the most important ways in which adventurers interact with the environment
    in such places. The Dungeon Master's Guide has rules covering more unusual situations.
