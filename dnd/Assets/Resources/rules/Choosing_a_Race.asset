  title: Choosing a Race
  description: Humans are the most common people in the worlds of D&D, but they live
    and work alongside dwarves, elves, halflings, and countless other fantastic species.
    Your character belongs to one of these peoples. Not every intelligent race of
    the multiverse is appropriate for a player-controlled adventurer. Dwarves, elves,
    halflings, and humans are the most common races to produce the sort of adventurers
    who make up typical parties. Other races and subraces are less common as adventurers.
    Your choice of race affects many different aspects of your character. It establishes
    fundamental qualities that exist throughout your character's adventuring career.
    When making this decision, keep in mind the kind of character you want to play.
    For example, a halfling could be a good choice for a sneaky rogue, a dwarf makes
    a tough warrior, and an elf can be a master of arcane magic. Your character race
    not only affects your ability scores and traits but also provides the cues for
    building your character's story. Each race's description in this chapter includes
    information to help you roleplay a character of that race, including personality,
    physical appearance, features of society, and racial alignment tendencies. These
    details are suggestions to help you think about your character; adventurers can
    deviate widely from the norm for their race. It's worthwhile to consider why
    your character is different, as a helpful way to think about your character's
    background and personality. Racial Traits The description of each race includes
    racial traits that are common to members of that race. The following entries
    appear among the traits of most races. Ability Score Increase Every race increases
    one or more of a character's ability scores. Age The age entry notes the age
    when a member of the race is considered an adult, as well as the race's expected
    lifespan. This information can help you decide how old your character is at the
    start of the game. You can choose any age for your character, which could provide
    an explanation for some of your ability scores. For example, if you play a young
    or very old character, your age could explain a particularly low Strength or
    Constitution score, while advanced age could account for a high Intelligence
    or Wisdom. Size Characters of most races are Medium, a size category including
    creatures that are roughly 4 to 8 feet tall. Members of a few races are Small
    (between 2 and 4 feet tall), which means that certain rules of the game affect
    them differently. The most important of these rules is that Small characters
    have trouble wielding heavy weapons, as explained in chapter 5. Speed Your speed
    determines how far you can move when traveling (chapter 8) and fighting (chapter
    9). Languages By virtue of your race, your character can speak, read, and write
    certain languages. Chapter 4 lists the most common languages of the D&D multiverse.
    Subraces Some races have subraces. Members of a subrace have the traits of the
    parent race in addition to the traits specified for their subrace. Relationships
    among subraces vary significantly from race to race and world to world. In the
    Dragonlance campaign setting, for example, mountain dwarves and hill dwarves
    live together as different clans of the same people, but in the Forgotten Realms,
    they live far apart in separate kingdoms and call themselves shield dwarves and
    gold dwarves, respectively.
