  description: Underwater Combat When adventurers pursue sahuagin back to their undersea
    homes, fight off sharks in an ancient shipwreck, or find themselves in a flooded
    dungeon room, they must fight in a challenging environment. Underwater the following
    rules apply. When making a melee weapon attack, a creature that doesn't have
    a swimming speed (either natural or granted by magic) has disadvantage on the
    attack roll unless the weapon is a dagger, javelin, shortsword, spear, or trident.
    A ranged weapon attack automatically misses a target beyond the weapon's normal
    range. Even against a target within normal range, the attack roll has disadvantage
    unless the weapon is a crossbow, a net, or a weapon that is thrown like a javelin
    (including a spear, trident, or dart). Creatures and objects that are fully immersed
    in water have resistance to fire damage.
