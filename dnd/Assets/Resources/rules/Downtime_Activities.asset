  title: Downtime Activities
  description: Between adventures, the DM might ask you what your character is doing
    during his or her downtime. Periods of downtime can vary in duration, but each
    downtime activity requires a certain number of days to complete before you gain
    any benefit, and at least 8 hours of each day must be spent on the downtime activity
    for the day to count. The days do not need to be consecutive. If you have more
    than the minimum amount of days to spend, you can keep doing the same thing for
    a longer period of time, or switch to a new downtime activity.Downtime activities
    other than the ones presented below are possible. If you want your character
    to spend his or her downtime performing an activity not covered here, discuss
    it with your DM.
