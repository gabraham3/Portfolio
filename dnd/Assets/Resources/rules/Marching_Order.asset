  title: Marching Order
  description: The adventurers should establish a marching order.A marching order
    makes it easier to determine which characters are affected by traps, which ones
    can spot hidden enemies, and which ones are the closest to those enemies when
    a fight breaks out.A character might occupy the front rank, one or more middle
    ranks, or the back rank. Characters in the front and back ranks need enough room
    to travel side by side with others in their rank. When space is too tight, the
    marching order must change, usually by moving characters to a middle rank.Fewer
    Than Three Ranks. If an adventuring party arranges its marching order with only
    two ranks, they are a front rank and a back rank. If there's only one rank, it's
    considered a front rank.
