  title: Suffocating
  description: A creature can hold its breath for a number of minutes equal to 1
    + its Constitution modifier (minimum of 30 seconds).When a creature runs out
    of breath or is choking, it can survive for a number of rounds equal to its Constitution
    modifier (minimum of 1 round). At the start of its next turn, it drops to 0 hit
    points and is dying, and it can't regain hit points or be stabilized until it
    can breathe again.For example, a creature with a Constitution of 14 can hold
    its breath for 3 minutes. If it starts suffocating, it has 2 rounds to reach
    air before it drops to 0 hit points.
