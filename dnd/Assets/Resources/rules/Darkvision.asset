  title: Darkvision
  description: Many creatures in fantasy gaming worlds, especially those that dwell
    underground, have darkvision. Within a specified range, a creature with darkvision
    can see in dim light as if it were bright light and in darkness as if it were
    dim light, so areas of darkness are only lightly obscured as far as that creature
    is concerned. However, the creature can't discern color in that darkness, only
    shades of gray.
