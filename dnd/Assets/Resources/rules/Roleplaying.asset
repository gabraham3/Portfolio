  description: 'Roleplaying is, literally, the act of playing out a role. In this
    case, it''s you as a player determining how your character thinks, acts, and
    talks.Roleplaying is a part of every aspect of the game, and it comes to the
    fore during social interactions. Your character''s quirks, mannerisms, and personality
    influence how interactions resolve.There are two styles you can use when roleplaying
    your character: the descriptive approach and the active approach. Most players
    use a combination of the two styles. Use whichever mix of the two works best
    for you.'
