  CTitle: Step-by-Step Characters
  title: Beyond 1st Level
  description: As your character goes on adventures and overcomes challenges, he
    or she gains experience, represented by experience points. A character who reaches
    a specified experience point total advances in capability. This advancement is
    called gaining a level. When your character gains a level, his or her class often
    grants additional features, as detailed in the class description. Some of these
    features allow you to increase your ability scores, either increasing two scores
    by 1 each or increasing one score by 2. You can't increase an ability score above
    20. In addition, every character's proficiency bonus increases at certain levels.
    Each time you gain a level, you gain 1 additional Hit Die. Roll that Hit Die,
    add your Constitution modifier to the roll, and add the total (minimum of 1)
    to your hit point maximum. Alternatively, you can use the fixed value shown in
    your class entry, which is the average result of the die roll (rounded up). When
    your Constitution modifier increases by 1, your hit point maximum increases by
    1 for each level you have attained. For example, when Bruenor reaches 8th level
    as a fighter, he increases his Constitution score from 17 to 18, thus increasing
    his Constitution modifier from +3 to +4. His hit point maximum then increases
    by 8. The Character Advancement table summarizes the XP you need to advance in
    levels from level 1 through level 20, and the proficiency bonus for a character
    of that level. Consult the information in your character's class description
    to see what other improvements you gain at each level. Tiers of Play The shading
    in the Character Advancement table shows the four tiers of play. The tiers don't
    have any rules associated with them; they are a general description of how the
    play experience changes as characters gain levels. In the first tier (levels
    1-4), characters are effectively apprentice adventurers. They are learning the
    features that define them as members of particular classes, including the major
    choices that flavor their class features as they advance (such as a wizard's
    Arcane Tradition or a fighter's Martial Archetype). The threats they face are
    relatively minor, usually posing a danger to local farmsteads or villages. In
    the second tier (levels 5-10), characters come into their own. Many spellcasters
    gain access to 3rd-level spells at the start of this tier, crossing a new threshold
    of magical power with spells such as fireball and lightning bolt. At this tier,
    many weapon-using classes gain the ability to make multiple attacks in one round.
    These characters have become important, facing dangers that threaten cities and
    kingdoms. In the third tier (levels 11-16), characters have reached a level of
    power that sets them high above the ordinary populace and makes them special
    even among adventurers. At 11th level, many spellcasters gain access to 6th-level
    spells, some of which create effects previously impossible for player characters
    to achieve. Other characters gain features that allow them to make more attacks
    or do more impressive things with those attacks. These mighty adventurers often
    confront threats to whole regions and continents. At the fourth tier (levels
    17-20), characters achieve the pinnacle of their class features, becoming heroic
    (or villainous) archetypes in their own right. The fate of the world or even
    the fundamental order of the multiverse might hang in the balance during their
    adventures.
