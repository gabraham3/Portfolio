  description: The DM uses your character's actions and attitudes to determine how
    an NPC reacts. A cowardly NPC buckles under threats of violence. A stubborn dwarf
    refuses to let anyone badger her. A vain dragon laps up flattery.When interacting
    with an NPC, pay close attention to the DM's portrayal of the NPC's mood, dialogue,
    and personality. You might be able to determine an NPC's personality traits,
    ideals, flaws, and bonds, then play on them to influence the NPC's attitude.Interactions
    in D&D are much like interactions in real life. If you can offer NPCs something
    they want, threaten them with something they fear, or play on their sympathies
    and goals, you can use words to get almost anything you want. On the other hand,
    if you insult a proud warrior or speak ill of a noble's allies, your efforts
    to convince or deceive will fall short.
