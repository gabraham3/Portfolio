  description: 'Every story has a beginning. Your character''s background reveals
    where you came from, how you became an adventurer, and your place in the world.
    Your fighter might have been a courageous knight or a grizzled soldier. Your
    wizard could have been a sage or an artisan. Your rogue might have gotten by
    as a guild thief or commanded audiences as a jester. Choosing a background provides
    you with important story cues about your character''s identity. The most important
    question to ask about your background is what changed? Why did you stop doing
    whatever your background describes and start adventuring? Where did you get the
    money to purchase your starting gear, or, if you come from a wealthy background,
    why don''t you have more money? How did you learn the skills of your class? What
    sets you apart from ordinary people who share your background? The sample backgrounds
    in this chapter provide both concrete benefits (features, proficiencies, and
    languages) and roleplaying suggestions. Proficiencies Each background gives a
    character proficiency in two skills. Skills are described in chapter 7. In addition,
    most backgrounds give a character proficiency with one or more tools. Tools and
    tool proficiencies are detailed in chapter 5. If a character would gain the same
    proficiency from two different sources, he or she can choose a different proficiency
    of the same kind (skill or tool) instead. Languages Some backgrounds also allow
    characters to learn additional languages beyond those given by race. See ''Languages''
    earlier in this chapter. Equipment Each background provides a package of starting
    equipment. If you use the optional rule from chapter 5 to spend coin on gear,
    you do not receive the starting equipment from your background. Suggested Characteristics
    A background contains suggested personal characteristics based on your background.
    You can pick characteristics, roll dice to determine them randomly, or use the
    suggestions as inspiration for characteristics of your own creation. Customizing
    a Background You might want to tweak some of the features of a background so
    it better fits your character or the campaign setting. To customize a background,
    you can replace one feature with any other one, choose any two skills, and choose
    a total of two tool proficiencies or languages from the sample backgrounds. You
    can either use the equipment package from your background or spend coin on gear
    as described in chapter 5. (If you spend coin, you can''t also take the equipment
    package suggested for your class.) Finally, choose two personality traits, one
    ideal, one bond, and one flaw. If you can''t find a feature that matches your
    desired background, work with your DM to create one. Tika and Artemis: Backgrounds
    Tika Waylan and Artemis Entreri both lived their earliest years as street urchins.
    Tika''s later career as a barmaid didn''t really change her, so she might choose
    the urchin background, gaining proficiency in the Sleight of Hand and Stealth
    skills, and learning the tools of the thieving trade. Artemis is more defined
    by his criminal background, giving him skills in Deception and Stealth, as well
    as proficiency with the tools of thievery and poison.'
