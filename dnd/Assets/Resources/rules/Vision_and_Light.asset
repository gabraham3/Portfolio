  description: "The most fundamental tasks of adventuring\u2014noticing danger, finding
    hidden objects, hitting an enemy in combat, and targeting a spell, to name just
    a few\u2014rely heavily on a character's ability to see. Darkness and other effects
    that obscure vision can prove a significant hindrance.A given area might be lightly
    or heavily obscured. In a lightly obscured area, such as dim light, patchy fog,
    or moderate foliage, creatures have disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks
    that rely on sight.A heavily obscured area\u2014such as darkness, opaque fog,
    or dense foliage\u2014blocks vision entirely. A creature effectively suffers
    from the blinded condition when trying to see something in that area.The presence
    or absence of light in an environment creates three categories of illumination:
    bright light, dim light, and darkness.Bright light lets most creatures see normally.
    Even gloomy days provide bright light, as do torches, lanterns, fires, and other
    sources of illumination within a specific radius.Dim light, also called shadows,
    creates a lightly obscured area. An area of dim light is usually a boundary between
    a source of bright light, such as a torch, and surrounding darkness. The soft
    light of twilight and dawn also counts as dim light. A particularly brilliant
    full moon might bathe the land in dim light.Darkness creates a heavily obscured
    area. Characters face darkness outdoors at night (even most moonlit nights),
    within the confines of an unlit dungeon or a subterranean vault, or in an area
    of magical darkness."
