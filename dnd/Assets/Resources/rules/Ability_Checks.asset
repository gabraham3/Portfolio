  title: Ability Checks
  description: In addition to roleplaying, ability checks are key in determining
    the outcome of an interaction.Your roleplaying efforts can alter an NPC's attitude,
    but there might still be an element of chance in the situation. For example,
    your DM can call for a Charisma check at any point during an interaction if he
    or she wants the dice to play a role in determining an NPC's reactions. Other
    checks might be appropriate in certain situations, at your DM's discretion.Pay
    attention to your skill proficiencies when thinking of how you want to interact
    with an NPC, and stack the deck in your favor by using an approach that relies
    on your best bonuses and skills. If the group needs to trick a guard into letting
    them into a castle, the rogue who is proficient in Deception is the best bet
    to lead the discussion. When negotiating for a hostage's release, the cleric
    with Persuasion should do most of the talking.
