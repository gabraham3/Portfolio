  title: Short Rest
  description: A short rest is a period of downtime, at least 1 hour long, during
    which a character does nothing more strenuous than eating, drinking, reading,
    and tending to wounds.A character can spend one or more Hit Dice at the end of
    a short rest, up to the character's maximum number of Hit Dice, which is equal
    to the character's level. For each Hit Die spent in this way, the player rolls
    the die and adds the character's Constitution modifier to it. The character regains
    hit points equal to the total (minimum of 0). The player can decide to spend
    an additional Hit Die after each roll. A character regains some spent Hit Dice
    upon finishing a long rest, as explained below.
