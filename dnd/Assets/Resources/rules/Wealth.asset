  description: "Wealth appears in many forms in a D&D world. Coins, gemstones, trade
    goods, art objects, animals, and property can reflect your character's financial
    well-being. Members of the peasantry trade in goods, bartering for what they
    need and paying taxes in grain and cheese. Members of the nobility trade in legal
    rights, such as the rights to mine, a port, or farmland, or in gold bars, measuring
    gold by the pound rather than by the coin. Only merchants, adventurers, and those
    offering professional services for hire deal in coins.Coinage. Common coins come
    in several different denominations based on the relative worth of the metal from
    which they are made. The three most common coins are the gold piece (gp), the
    silver piece (sp), and the copper piece (cp). With one gold piece, a character
    can buy a quiver, 50 feet of good rope, or a goat. A skilled (but not exceptional)
    artisan can earn one gold piece a day. The gold piece is the standard unit of
    measure for wealth, even if the coin itself is not commonly used. When merchants
    discuss deals that involve goods or services worth hundreds or thousands of gold
    pieces, the transactions don't usually involve the exchange of individual coins.
    Rather, the gold piece is a standard measure of value, and the actual exchange
    is in gold bars, letters of credit, or valuable goods. One gold piece is worth
    ten silver pieces, the most prevalent coin among commoners. A silver piece buys
    a set of dice, a flask of lamp oil, or a night's rest in a poor inn. One silver
    piece is worth ten copper pieces, which are common among laborers and beggars.
    A single copper piece buys a candle, a torch, or a piece of chalk. In addition,
    unusual coins made of other precious metals sometimes appear in treasure hoards.
    The electrum piece (ep) and the platinum piece (pp) originate from fallen empires
    and lost kingdoms, and they sometimes arouse suspicion and skepticism when used
    in transactions. An electrum piece is worth five silver pieces, and a platinum
    piece is worth ten gold pieces. A standard coin weighs about a third of an ounce,
    so fifty coins weigh a pound. Selling Treasure Opportunities abound to find treasure,
    equipment, weapons, armor, and more in the dungeons you explore. Normally, you
    can sell your treasures and trinkets when you return to a town or other settlement,
    provided that you can find buyers and merchants interested in your loot. Arms,
    Armor, and Other Equipment. As a general rule, undamaged weapons, armor, and
    other equipment fetch half their cost when sold in a market. Weapons and armor
    used by monsters are rarely in good enough condition to sell. Magic Items. Selling
    magic items is problematic. Finding someone to buy a potion or a scroll isn't
    too hard, but other items are out of the realm of most but the wealthiest nobles.
    Likewise, aside from a few common magic items, you won't normally come across
    magic items or spells to purchase. The value of magic is far beyond simple gold
    and should always be treated as such. Gems, Jewelry, and Art Objects. These items
    retain their full value in the marketplace, and you can either trade them in
    for coin or use them as currency for other transactions. For exceptionally valuable
    treasures, the DM might require you to find a buyer in a large town or larger
    community first. Trade Goods and Other. On the borderlands, many people conduct
    transactions through barter. Like gems and art objects, trade goods\u2014bars
    of iron, bags of salt, livestock, and so on\u2014retain their full value in the
    market and can be used as currency."
