  title: Mounts and Vehicles
  description: A good mount can help you move more quickly through the wilderness,
    but its primary purpose is to carry the gear that would otherwise slow you down.
    The Mounts and Other Animals table shows each animal's speed and base carrying
    capacity. An animal pulling a carriage, cart, chariot, sled, or wagon can move
    weight up to five times its base carrying capacity, including the weight of the
    vehicle. If multiple animals pull the same vehicle, they can add their carrying
    capacity together. Mounts other than those listed here are available in the worlds
    of D&D, but they are rare and not normally available for purchase. These include
    flying mounts (pegasi, griffons, hippogriffs, and similar animals) and even aquatic
    mounts (giant sea horses, for example). Acquiring such a mount often means securing
    an egg and raising the creature yourself, making a bargain with a powerful entity,
    or negotiating with the mount itself. Barding Barding is armor designed to protect
    an animal's head, neck, chest, and body. Any type of armor shown on the Armor
    table in this chapter can be purchased as barding. The cost is four times the
    equivalent armor made for humanoids, and it weighs twice as much. Saddles A military
    saddle braces the rider, helping you keep your seat on an active mount in battle.
    It gives you advantage on any check you make to remain mounted. An exotic saddle
    is required for riding any aquatic or flying mount. Vehicle Proficiency If you
    have proficiency with a certain kind of vehicle (land or water), you can add
    your proficiency bonus to any check you make to control that kind of vehicle
    in difficult circumstances. Rowed Vessels Keelboats and rowboats are used on
    lakes and rivers. If going downstream, add the speed of the current (typically
    3 miles per hour) to the speed of the vehicle. These vehicles can't be rowed
    against any significant current, but they can be pulled upstream by draft animals
    on the shores. A rowboat weighs 100 pounds, in case adventurers carry it over
    land.
