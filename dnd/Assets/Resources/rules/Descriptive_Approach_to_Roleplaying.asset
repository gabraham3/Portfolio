  title: Descriptive Approach to Roleplaying
  description: With this approach, you describe your character's words and actions
    to the DM and the other players. Drawing on your mental image of your character,
    you tell everyone what your character does and how he or she does it.For instance,
    Chris plays Tordek the dwarf. Tordek has a quick temper and blames the elves
    of the Cloakwood for his family's misfortune. At a tavern, an obnoxious elf minstrel
    sits at Tordek's table and tries to strike up a conversation with the dwarf.Chris
    says, 'Tordek spits on the floor, growls an insult at the bard, and stomps over
    to the bar. He sits on a stool and glares at the minstrel before ordering another
    drink.' In this example, Chris has conveyed Tordek's mood and given the DM a
    clear idea of his character's attitude and actions.When using descriptive roleplaying,
    keep the following things in mind:Describe your character's emotions and attitude.Focus
    on your character's intent and how others might perceive it.Provide as much embellishment
    as you feel comfortable with.Don't worry about getting things exactly right.
    Just focus on thinking about what your character would do and describing what
    you see in your mind.
