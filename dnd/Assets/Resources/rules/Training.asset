    must find an instructor willing to teach you. The DM determines how long it takes,
    and whether one or more ability checks are required.The training lasts for 250
    days and costs 1 gp per day. After you spend the requisite amount of time and
    money, you learn the new language or gain proficiency with the new tool.
