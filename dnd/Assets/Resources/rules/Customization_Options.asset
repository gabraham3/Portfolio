  description: "The combination of ability scores, race, class, and background defines
    your character's capabilities in the game, and the personal details you create
    set your character apart from every other character. Even within your class and
    race, you have options to fine-tune what your character can do. But a few players\u2014with
    the DM's permission\u2014want to go a step further. Chapter 6 of the Player's
    Handbook defines two optional sets of rules for customizing your character: multiclassing
    and feats. Multiclassing lets you combine classes together, and feats are special
    options you can choose instead of increasing your ability scores as you gain
    levels. Your DM decides whether these options are available in a campaign."
