  description: "A feat represents a talent or an area of expertise that gives a character
    special capabilities. It embodies training, experience, and abilities beyond
    what a class provides. See chapter 6 of the Player's Handbook for more information.
    At certain levels, your class gives you the Ability Score Improvement feature.
    Using the optional feats rule, you can forgo taking that feature to take a feat
    of your choice instead. You can take each feat only once, unless the feat's description
    says otherwise. You must meet any prerequisite specified in a feat to take that
    feat. If you ever lose a feat's prerequisite, you can't use that feat until you
    regain the prerequisite. For example, the Grappler feat requires you to have
    a Strength of 13 or higher. If your Strength is reduced below 13 somehow\u2014perhaps
    by a withering curse\u2014you can't benefit from the Grappler feat until your
    Strength is restored."
