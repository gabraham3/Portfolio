  description: Characters are defined by much more than their race and class. They're
    individuals with their own stories, interests, connections, and capabilities
    beyond those that class and race define. This chapter expounds on the details
    that distinguish characters from one another, including the basics of name and
    physical description, the rules of backgrounds and languages, and the finer points
    of personality and alignment.
