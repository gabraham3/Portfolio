  description: Magic permeates the worlds of D&D and most often appears in the form
    of a spell. This chapter provides the rules for casting spells. Different character
    classes have distinctive ways of learning and preparing their spells, and monsters
    use spells in unique ways. Regardless of its source, a spell follows the rules
    here.
