  title: Resting
  description: Heroic though they might be, adventurers can't spend every hour of
    the day in the thick of exploration, social interaction, and combat. They need
    rest-time to sleep and eat, tend their wounds, refresh their minds and spirits
    for spellcasting, and brace themselves for further adventure.Adventurers, as
    well as other creatures, can take short rests in the midst of a day and a long
    rest to end it
