  Description:
  - " This spell grants the ability to move across any liquid surface\u2014such as
    water, acid, mud, snow, quicksand, or lava\u2014as if it were harmless solid
    ground (creatures crossing molten lava can still take damage from the heat).
    Up to ten willing creatures you can see within range gain this ability for the
    duration. If you target a creature submerged in a liquid, the spell carries the
    target to the surface of the liquid at a rate of 60 feet per round."
