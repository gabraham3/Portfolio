  Description:
  - "You create a floating, spectral weapon within range that lasts for the duration
    or until you cast this spell again. When you cast the spell, you can make a melee
    spell attack against a creature within 5 feet of the weapon. On a hit, the target
    takes force damage equal to 1d8 + your spellcasting ability modifier. As a bonus
    action on your turn, you can move the weapon up to 20 feet and repeat the attack
    against a creature within 5 feet of it. The weapon can take whatever form you
    choose. Clerics of deities who are associated with a particular weapon (as St.
    Cuthbert is known for his mace and Thor for his hammer) make this spell\u2019s
    effect resemble that weapon."
  - At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or
    higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for every two slot levels above the 2nd.
