  Description:
  - " This spell reverses gravity in a 50-foot-radius, 100- foot high cylinder centered
    on a point within range. All creatures and objects that aren\u2019t somehow anchored
    to the ground in the area fall upward and reach the top of the area when you
    cast this spell. A creature can make a Dexterity saving throw to grab onto a
    fixed object it can reach, thus avoiding the fall. If some solid object (such
    as a ceiling) is encountered in this fall, falling objects and creatures strike
    it just as they would during a normal downward fall. If an object or creature
    reaches the top of the area without striking anything, it remains there, oscillating
    slightly, for the duration. At the end of the duration, affected objects and
    creatures fall back down."
