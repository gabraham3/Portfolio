  Description:
  - "A 10-foot-radius immobile dome of force springs into existence around and above
    you and remains stationary for the duration. The spell ends if you leave its
    area. Nine creatures of Medium size or smaller can fit inside the dome with you.
    The spell fails if its area includes a larger creature or more than nine creatures.
    Creatures and objects within the dome when you cast this spell can move through
    it freely. All other creatures and objects are barred from passing through it.
    Spells and other magical effects can\u2019t extend through the dome or be cast
    through it. The atmosphere inside the space is comfortable and dry, regardless
    of the weather outside. Until the spell ends, you can command the interior to
    become dimly lit or dark. The dome is opaque from the outside, of any color you
    choose, but it is transparent from the inside."
