  Description:
  - You throw a nonmagical weapon or fire a piece of nonmagical ammunition into the
    air to create a cone of identical weapons that shoot forward and then disappear.
    Each creature in a 60-foot cone must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw. A creature
    takes 3d8 damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
    The damage type is the same as that of the weapon or ammunition used as a component.
  Level: 3rd-level
