  Description:
  - "Your touch inflicts disease. Make a melee spell attack against a creature within
    your reach. On a hit, you afflict the creature with a disease of your choice
    from any of the ones described below. At the end of each of the target\u2019s
    turns, it must make a Constitution saving throw. After failing three of these
    saving throws, the disease\u2019s effects last for the duration, and the creature
    stops making these saves. After succeeding on three of these saving throws, the
    creature recovers from the disease, and the spell ends. Since this spell induces
    a natural disease in its target, any effect that removes a disease or otherwise
    ameliorates a disease\u2019s effects apply to it. Blinding Sickness. Pain grips
    the creature\u2019s mind, and its eyes turn milky white. The creature has disadvantage
    on Wisdom checks and Wisdom saving throws and is blinded. Filth Fever. A raging
    fever sweeps through the creature\u2019s body. The creature has disadvantage
    on Strength checks, Strength saving throws, and attack rolls that use Strength.
    Flesh Rot. The creature\u2019s flesh decays. The creature has disadvantage on
    Charisma checks and vulnerability to all damage. Mindfire. The creature\u2019s
    mind becomes feverish. The creature has disadvantage on Intelligence checks and
    Intelligence saving throws, and the creature behaves as if under the effects
    of the confusion spell during combat. Seizure. The creature is overcome with
    shaking. The creature has disadvantage on Dexterity checks, Dexterity saving
    throws, and attack rolls that use Dexterity. Slimy Doom. The creature begins
    to bleed uncontrollably. The creature has disadvantage on Constitution checks
    and Constitution saving throws. In addition, whenever the creature takes damage,
    it is stunned until the end of its next turn."
