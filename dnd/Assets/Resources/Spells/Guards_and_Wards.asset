  Description:
  - "You create a ward that protects up to 2,500 square feet of floor space (an area
    50 feet square, or one hundred 5-foot squares or twenty-five 10-foot squares).
    The warded area can be up to 20 feet tall, and shaped as you desire. You can
    ward several stories of a stronghold by dividing the area among them, as long
    as you can walk into each contiguous area while you are casting the spell. When
    you cast this spell, you can specify individuals that are unaffected by any or
    all of the effects that you choose. You can also specify a password that, when
    spoken aloud, makes the speaker immune to these effects. Guards and wards creates
    the following effects within the warded area. Corridors. Fog fills all the warded
    corridors, making them heavily obscured. In addition, at each intersection or
    branching passage offering a choice of direction, there is a 50 percent chance
    that a creature other than you will believe it is going in the opposite direction
    from the one it chooses. Doors. All doors in the warded area are magically locked,
    as if sealed by an arcane lock spell. In addition, you can cover up to ten doors
    with an illusion (equivalent to the illusory object function of the minor illusion
    spell) to make them appear as plain sections of wall. Stairs. Webs fill all stairs
    in the warded area from top to bottom, as the web spell. These strands regrow
    in 10 minutes if they are burned or torn away while guards and wards lasts. Other
    Spell Effect. You can place your choice of one of the following magical effects
    within the warded area of the stronghold. \u2022 Place dancing lights in four
    corridors. You can desig nate a simple program that the lights repeat as long
    as guards and wards lasts. \u2022 Place magic mouth in two locations. \u2022
    Place stinking cloud in two locations. The vapors appear in the places you designate;
    they return within 10 minutes if dispersed by wind while guards and wards lasts.
    \u2022 Place a constant gust of wind in one corridor or room. \u2022 Place a
    suggestion in one location. You select an area of up to 5 feet square, and any
    creature that enters or passes through the area receives the suggestion mentally.
    The whole warded area radiates magic. A dispel magic cast on a specific effect,
    if successful, removes only that effect. You can create a permanently guarded
    and warded structure by casting this spell there every day for one year."
