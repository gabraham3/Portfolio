  Description:
  - "You step into the border regions of the Ethereal Plane, in the area where it
    overlaps with your current plane. You remain in the Border Ethereal for the duration
    or until you use your action to dismiss the spell. During this time, you can
    move in any direction. If you move up or down, every foot of movement costs an
    extra foot. You can see and hear the plane you originated from, but everything
    there looks gray, and you can\u2019t see anything more than 60 feet away. While
    on the Ethereal Plane, you can only affect and be affected by other creatures
    on that plane. Creatures that aren't on the Ethereal Plane can\u2019t perceive
    you and can\u2019t interact with you, unless a special ability or magic has given
    them the ability to do so. You ignore all objects and effects that aren\u2019t
    on the Ethereal Plane, allowing you to move through objects you perceive on the
    plane you originated from. When the spell ends, you immediately return to the
    plane you originated from in the spot you currently occupy. If you occupy the
    same spot as a solid object or creature when this happens, you are immediately
    shunted to the nearest unoccupied space that you can occupy and take force damage
    equal to twice the number of feet you are moved. This spell has no effect if
    you cast it while you are on the Ethereal Plane or a plane that doesn\u2019t
    border it, such as one of the Outer Planes."
  - At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 8th level or
    higher, you can target up to three willing creatures (including you) for each
    slot level above 7th. The creatures must be within 10 feet of you when you cast
    the spell.
