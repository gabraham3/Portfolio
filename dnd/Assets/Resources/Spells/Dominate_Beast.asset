  Description:
  - "You attempt to beguile a beast that you can see within range. It must succeed
    on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration. If you or creatures
    that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw.
    While the beast is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as the
    two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic link
    to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required),
    which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of
    action, such as \u201CAttack that creature,' \u201CRun over there,' or \u201CFetch
    that object.' If the creature completes the order and doesn\u2019t receive further
    direction from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability.
    You can use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until
    the end of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and
    doesn\u2019t do anything that you don\u2019t allow it to do. During this time,
    you can also cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use
    your own reaction as well. Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new
    Wisdom saving throw against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell
    ends."
  - At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell with a 5th-level spell slot, the duration
    is concentration, up to 10 minutes. When you use a 6th-level spell slot, the
    duration is concentration, up to 1 hour. When you use a spell slot of 7th level
    or higher, the duration is concentration, up to 8 hours.
