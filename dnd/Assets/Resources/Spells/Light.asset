  Description:
  - You touch one object that is no larger than 10 feet in any  dimension. Until
    the spell ends, the object sheds bright  light in a 20-foot radius and dim light
    for an additional  20 feet. The light can be colored as you like. Completely 
    covering the object with something opaque blocks the  light. The spell ends if
    you cast it again or dismiss it  as an action. If you target an object held or
    worn by a hostile  creature, that creature must succeed on a Dexterity  saving
    throw to avoid the spell.
