  Description:
  - "You create a Large hand of shimmering, translucent force in an unoccupied space
    that you can see within range. The hand lasts for the spell\u2019s duration,
    and it moves at your command, mimicking the movements of your own hand. The hand
    is an object that has AC 20 and hit points equal to your hit point maximum. If
    it drops to 0 hit points, the spell ends. It has a Strength of 26 (+8) and a
    Dexterity of 10 (+0). The hand doesn\u2019t fill its space. When you cast the
    spell and as a bonus action on your subsequent turns, you can move the hand up
    to 60 feet and then cause one of the following effects with it. Clenched Fist.
    The hand strikes one creature or object within 5 feet of it. Make a melee spell
    attack for the hand using your game statistics. On a hit, the target takes 4d8
    force damage. Forceful Hand. The hand attempts to push a creature within 5 feet
    of it in a direction you choose. Make a check with the hand\u2019s Strength contested
    by the Strength (Athletics) check of the target. If the target is Medium or smaller,
    you have advantage on the check. If you succeed, the hand pushes the target up
    to 5 feet plus a number of feet equal to five times your spellcasting ability
    modifier. The hand moves with the target to remain within 5 feet of it. Grasping
    Hand. The hand attempts to grapple a Huge or smaller creature within 5 feet of
    it. You use the hand\u2019s Strength score to resolve the grapple. If the target
    is Medium or smaller, you have advantage on the check. While the hand is grappling
    the target, you can use a bonus action to have the hand crush it. When you do
    so, the target takes bludgeoning damage equal to 2d6 + your spellcasting ability
    modifier. Interposing Hand. The hand interposes itself between you and a creature
    you choose until you give the hand a different command. The hand moves to stay
    between you and the target, providing you with half cover against the target.
    The target can't move through the hand\u2019s space if its Strength score is
    less than or equal to the hand\u2019s Strength score. If its Strength score is
    higher than the hand\u2019s Strength score, the target can move toward you through
    the hand\u2019s space, but that space is difficult terrain for the target."
  - At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or
    higher, the damage from the clenched fist option increases by 2d8 and the damage
    from the grasping hand increases by 2d6 for each slot level above 5th.
