  Description:
  - You attempt to charm a humanoid you can see within range. It must make a Wisdom
    saving throw, and does so with advantage if you or your companions are fighting
    it. If it fails the saving throw, it is charmed by you until the spell ends or
    until you or your companions do anything harmful to it. The charmed creature
    regards you as a friendly acquaintance. When the spell ends, the creature knows
    it was charmed by you.
  - At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or
    higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.
    The creatures must be within 30 feet of each other when you target them.
  Level: 1st-level
