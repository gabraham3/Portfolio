  Description:
  - "You create a seismic disturbance at a point on the ground that you can see within
    range. For the duration, an intense tremor rips through the ground in a 100-foot-radius
    circle centered on that point and shakes creatures and structures in contact
    with the ground in that area. The ground in the area becomes difficult terrain.
    Each creature on the ground that is concentrating must make a Constitution saving
    throw. On a failed save, the creature\u2019s concentration is broken. When you
    cast this spell and at the end of each turn you spend concentrating on it, each
    creature on the ground in the area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed
    save, the creature is knocked prone. This spell can have additional effects depending
    on the terrain in the area, as determined by the DM. Fissures. Fissures open
    throughout the spell\u2019s area at the start of your next turn after you cast
    the spell. A total of 1d6 such fissures open in locations chosen by the DM. Each
    is 1d10 x 10 feet deep, 10 feet wide, and extends from one edge of the spell\u2019s
    area to the opposite side. A creature standing on a spot where a fissure opens
    must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw or fall in. A creature that successfully
    saves moves with the fissure\u2019s edge as it opens. A fissure that opens beneath
    a structure causes it to automatically collapse (see below). Structures. The
    tremor deals 50 bludgeoning damage to any structure in contact with the ground
    in the area when you cast the spell and at the start of each of your turns until
    the spell ends. If a structure drops to 0 hit points, it collapses and potentially
    damages nearby creatures. A creature within half the distance of a structure\u2019s
    height must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes
    5d6 bludgeoning damage, is knocked prone, and is buried in the rubble, requiring
    a DC 20 Strength (Athletics) check as an action to escape. The DM can adjust
    the DC higher or lower, depending on the nature of the rubble. On a successful
    save, the creature takes half as much damage and doesn\u2019t fall prone or become
    buried."
