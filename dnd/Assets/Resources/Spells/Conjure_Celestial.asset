  Description:
  - "You summon a celestial of challenge rating 4 or lower, which appears in an unoccupied
    space that you can see within range. The celestial disappears when it drops to
    0 hit points or when the spell ends. The celestial is friendly to you and your
    companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the celestial, which has its
    own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required
    by you), as long as they don\u2019t violate its alignment. If you don\u2019t
    issue any commands to the celestial, it defends itself from hostile creatures
    but otherwise takes no actions. The DM has the celestial\u2019s statistics."
  - At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 9th-level spell slot, you
    summon a celestial of challenge rating 5 or lower.
  Level: 7th-level
