  Description:
  - "A 5-foot-diameter sphere of fire appears in an unoccupied space of your choice
    within range and lasts for the duration. Any creature that ends its turn within
    5 feet of the sphere must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature takes 2d6
    fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. As
    a bonus action, you can move the sphere up to 30 feet. If you ram the sphere
    into a creature, that creature must make the saving throw against the sphere\u2019s
    damage, and the sphere stops moving this turn. When you move the sphere, you
    can direct it over barriers up to 5 feet tall and jump it across pits up to 10
    feet wide. The sphere ignites flammable objects not being worn or carried, and
    it sheds bright light in a 20-foot radius and dim light for an additional 20
    feet."
  - At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or
    higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 2nd.
