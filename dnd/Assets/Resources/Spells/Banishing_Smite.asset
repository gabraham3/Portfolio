  Description:
  - "The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack before this spell ends,
    your weapon crackles with force, and the attack deals an extra 5d10 force damage
    to the target. Additionally, if this attack reduces the target to 50 hit points
    or fewer, you banish it. If the target is native to a different plane of existence
    than the one you\u2019re on, the target disappears, returning to its home plane.
    If the target is native to the plane you\u2019re on, the creature vanishes into
    a harmless demiplane. While there, the target is incapacitated. It remains there
    until the spell ends, at which point the target reappears in the space it left
    or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied."
