  Description:
  - "You attempt to interrupt a creature in the process of casting a spell. If the
    creature is casting a spell of 3rd level or lower, its spell fails and has no
    effect. If it is casting a spell of 4th level or higher, make an ability check
    using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals 10 + the spell\u2019s level. On
    a success, the creature\u2019s spell fails and has no effect."
  - At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or
    higher, the interrupted spell has no effect if its level is less than or equal
    to the level of the spell slot you used.
  Level: 3rd-level
