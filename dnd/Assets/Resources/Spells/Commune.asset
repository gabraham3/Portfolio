  Description:
  - "You contact your deity or a divine proxy and ask up to three questions that
    can be answered with a yes or no. You must ask your questions before the spell
    ends. You receive a correct answer for each question. Divine beings aren\u2019t
    necessarily omniscient, so you might receive \u201Cunclear' as an answer if a
    question pertains to information that lies beyond the deity\u2019s knowledge.
    In a case where a one-word answer could be misleading or contrary to the deity\u2019s
    interests, the DM might offer a short phrase as an answer instead. If you cast
    the spell two or more times before finishing your next long rest, there is a
    cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting after the first that you get no
    answer. The DM makes this roll in secret."
