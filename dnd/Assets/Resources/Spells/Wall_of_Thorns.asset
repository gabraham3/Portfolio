  School: Conjuration
  Description:
  - You create a wall of tough, pliable, tangled brush bristling with needle-sharp
    thorns. The wall appears within range on a solid surface and lasts for the duration.
    You choose to make the wall up to 60 feet long, 10 feet high, and 5 feet thick
    or a circle that has a 20-foot diameter and is up to 20 feet high and 5 feet
    thick. The wall blocks line of sight. When the wall appears, each creature within
    its area must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes
    7d8 piercing damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. A creature
    can move through the wall, albeit slowly and painfully. For every 1 foot a creature
    moves through the wall, it must spend 4 feet of movement. Furthermore, the first
    time a creature enters the wall on a turn or ends its turn there, the creature
    must make a Dexterity saving throw. It takes 7d8 slashing damage on a failed
    save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
  - At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or
    higher, both types of damage increase by 1d8 for each slot level above 6th.
