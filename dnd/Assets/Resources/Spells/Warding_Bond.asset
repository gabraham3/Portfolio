  Description:
  - ' This spell wards a willing creature you touch and creates a mystic connection
    between you and the target until the spell ends. While the target is within 60
    feet of you, it gains a +1 bonus to AC and saving throws, and it has resistance
    to all damage. Also, each time it takes damage, you take the same amount of damage.
    The spell ends if you drop to 0 hit points or if you and the target become separated
    by more than 60 feet. It also ends if the spell is cast again on either of the
    connected creatures. You can also dismiss the spell as an action.'
