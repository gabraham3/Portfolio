  Description:
  - "The next time you hit a creature with a melee weapon attack during this spell\u2019s
    duration, your weapon flares with bright light, and the attack deals an extra
    3d8 radiant damage to the target. Additionally, the target must succeed on a
    Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the spell ends. A creature blinded
    by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its
    turns. On a successful save, it is no longer blinded."
