  Name: Wall of Ice
  Classes:
  - Wizard
  School: Evocation
  Description:
  - " You create a wall of ice on a solid surface within range. You can form it into
    a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to 10 feet, or you can shape
    a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-square panels. Each panel must be contiguous
    with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1 foot thick and lasts for the duration.
    If the wall cuts through a creature\u2019s space when it appears, the creature
    within its area is pushed to one side of the wall and must make a Dexterity saving
    throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 10d6 cold damage, or half as much
    damage on a successful save. The wall is an object that can be damaged and thus
    breached. It has AC 12 and 30 hit points per 10-foot section, and it is vulnerable
    to fire damage. Reducing a 10-foot section of wall to 0 hit points destroys it
    and leaves behind a sheet of frigid air in the space the wall occupied. A creature
    moving through the sheet of frigid air for the first time on a turn must make
    a Constitution saving throw. That creature takes 5d6 cold damage on a failed
    save, or half as much damage on a successful one. At Higher Levels. When you
    cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or higher, the damage the wall
    deals when it appears increases by 2d6, and the damage from passing through the
    sheet of frigid air increases by 1d6, for each slot level above 6th."
