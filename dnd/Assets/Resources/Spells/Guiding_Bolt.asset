  Description:
  - A flash of light streaks toward a creature of your choice within range. Make
    a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target takes 4d6 radiant
    damage, and the next attack roll made against this target before the end of your
    next turn has advantage, thanks to the mystical dim light glittering on the target
    until then.
  - At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or
    higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
  Level: 1st-level
  score: 0
