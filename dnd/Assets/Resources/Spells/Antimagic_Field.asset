  Description:
  - "A 10-foot-radius invisible sphere of antimagic surrounds you. This area is divorced
    from the magical energy that suffuses the multiverse. Within the sphere, spells
    can\u2019t be cast, summoned creatures disappear, and even magic items become
    mundane. Until the spell ends, the sphere moves with you, centered on you. Spells
    and other magical effects, except those created by an artifact or a deity, are
    suppressed in the sphere and can\u2019t protrude into it. A slot expended to
    cast a suppressed spell is consumed. While an effect is suppressed, it doesn\u2019t
    function, but the time it spends suppressed counts against its duration. Targeted
    Effects. Spells and other magical effects, such as magic missile and charm person,
    that target a creature or an object in the sphere have no effect on that target.
    Areas of Magic. The area of another spell or magical effect, such as fireball,
    can\u2019t extend into the sphere. If the sphere overlaps an area of magic, the
    part of the area that is covered by the sphere is suppressed. For example, the
    flames created by a wall of fire are suppressed within the sphere, creating a
    gap in the wall if the overlap is large enough. Spells. Any active spell or other
    magical effect on a creature or an object in the sphere is suppressed while the
    creature or object is in it. Magic Items. The properties and powers of magic
    items are suppressed in the sphere. For example, a +1 longsword in the sphere
    functions as a nonmagical longsword. A magic weapon\u2019s properties and powers
    are suppressed if it is used against a target in the sphere or wielded by an
    attacker in the sphere. If a magic weapon or a piece of magic ammunition fully
    leaves the sphere (for example, if you fire a magic arrow or throw a magic spear
    at a target outside the sphere), the magic of the item ceases to be suppressed
    as soon as it exits. Magical Travel. Teleportation and planar travel fail to
    work in the sphere, whether the sphere is the destination or the departure point
    for such magical travel. A portal to another location, world, or plane of existence,
    as well as an opening to an extradimensional space such as that created by the
    rope trick spell, temporarily closes while in the sphere. Creatures and Objects.
    A creature or object summoned or created by magic temporarily winks out of existence
    in the sphere. Such a creature instantly reappears once the space the creature
    occupied is no longer within the sphere. Dispel Magic. Spells and magical effects
    such as dispel magic have no effect on the sphere. Likewise, the spheres created
    by different antimagic field spells don\u2019t nullify each other."
