  Description:
  - "Whispering to the spirits of nature, you create one of the following effects
    within range: \u2022 You create a tiny, harmless sensory effect that predicts
    what the weather will be at your location for the next 24 hours. The effect might
    manifest as a golden orb for clear skies, a cloud for rain, falling snowflakes
    for snow, and so on. This effect persists for 1 round. \u2022 You instantly make
    a flower blossom, a seed pod open, or a leaf bud bloom. \u2022 You create an
    instantaneous, harmless sensory effect, such as falling leaves, a puff of wind,
    the sound of a small animal, or the faint odor of skunk. The effect must fit
    in a 5-foot cube. \u2022 You instantly light or snuff out a candle, a torch,
    or a small campfire."
