  Description:
  - "A line of strong wind 60 feet long and 10 feet wide blasts from you in a direction
    you choose for the spell\u2019s duration. Each creature that starts its turn
    in the line must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be pushed 15 feet away
    from you in a direction following the line. Any creature in the line must spend
    2 feet of movement for every 1 foot it moves when moving closer to you. The gust
    disperses gas or vapor, and it extinguishes candles, torches, and similar unprotected
    flames in the area. It causes protected flames, such as those of lanterns, to
    dance wildly and has a 50 percent chance to extinguish them. As a bonus action
    on each of your turns before the spell ends, you can change the direction in
    which the line blasts from you."
