  Description:
  - "You summon a fey creature of challenge rating 6 or lower, or a fey spirit that
    takes the form of a beast of challenge rating 6 or lower. It appears in an unoccupied
    space that you can see within range. The fey creature disappears when it drops
    to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. The fey creature is friendly to you and
    your companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the creature, which has
    its own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required
    by you), as long as they don't violate its alignment. If you don\u2019t issue
    any commands to the fey creature, it defends itself from hostile creatures but
    otherwise takes no actions. If your concentration is broken, the fey creature
    doesn\u2019t disappear. Instead, you lose control of the fey creature, it becomes
    hostile toward you and your companions, and it might attack. An uncontrolled
    fey creature can't be dismissed by you, and it disappears 1 hour after you summoned
    it. The DM has the fey creature\u2019s statistics."
  - At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or
    higher, the challenge rating increases by 1 for each slot level above 6th.
