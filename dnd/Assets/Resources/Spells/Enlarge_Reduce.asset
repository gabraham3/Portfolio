  Description:
  - "You cause a creature or an object you can see within range to grow larger or
    smaller for the duration. Choose either a creature or an object that is neither
    worn nor carried. If the target is unwilling, it can make a Constitution saving
    throw. On a success, the spell has no effect. If the target is a creature, everything
    it is wearing and carrying changes size with it. Any item dropped by an affected
    creature returns to normal size at once. Enlarge. The target\u2019s size doubles
    in all dimensions, and its weight is multiplied by eight. This growth increases
    its size by one category\u2014from Medium to Large, for example. If there isn\u2019t
    enough room for the target to double its size, the creature or object attains
    the maximum possible size in the space available. Until the spell ends, the target
    also has advantage on Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target\u2019s
    weapons also grow to match its new size. While these weapons are enlarged, the
    target\u2019s attacks with them deal 1d4 extra damage. Reduce. The target\u2019s
    size is halved in all dimensions, and its weight is reduced to one-eighth of
    normal. This reduction decreases its size by one category\u2014from Medium to
    Small, for example. Until the spell ends, the target also has disadvantage on
    Strength checks and Strength saving throws. The target\u2019s weapons also shrink
    to match its new size. While these weapons are reduced, the target\u2019s attacks
    with them deal 1d4 less damage (this can\u2019t reduce the damage below 1)."
