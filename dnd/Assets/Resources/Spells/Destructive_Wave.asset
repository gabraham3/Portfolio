  Description:

    from you. Each creature you choose within 30 feet of you must succeed on a Constitution
    saving throw or take 5d6 thunder damage, as well as 5d6 radiant or necrotic damage
    (your choice), and be knocked prone. A creature that succeeds on its saving throw
    takes half as much damage and isn\u2019t knocked prone."
