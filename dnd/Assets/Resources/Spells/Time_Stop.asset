  Description:
  - You briefly stop the flow of time for everyone but yourself. No time passes for
    other creatures, while you take 1d4 + 1 turns in a row, during which you can
    use actions and move as normal. This spell ends if one of the actions you use
    during this period, or any effects that you create during this period, affects
    a creature other than you or an object being worn or carried by someone other
    than you. In addition, the spell ends if you move to a place more than 1,000
    feet from the location where you cast it.
