  Description:
  - "You conjure a phantom watchdog in an unoccupied space that you can see within
    range, where it remains for the duration, until you dismiss it as an action,
    or until you move more than 100 feet away from it.The hound is invisible to all
    creatures except you and can't be harmed. When a Small or larger creature comes
    within 30 feet of it without first speaking the password that you specify when
    you cast this spell, the hound starts barking loudly. The hound sees invisible
    creatures and can see into the Ethereal Plane. It ignores illusions.At the start
    of each of your turns, the hound attempts to bite one creature within 5 feet
    of it that is hostile to you. The hound\u2019s attack bonus is equal to your
    spellcasting ability modifier + your proficiency bonus.On a hit, it deals 4d8
    piercing damage."
