  Description:
  - You evoke a fiery blade in your free hand. The blade is similar in size and shape
    to a scimitar, and it lasts for the duration. If you let go of the blade, it
    disappears, but you can evoke the blade again as a bonus action. You can use
    your action to make a melee spell attack with the fiery blade. On a hit, the
    target takes 3d6 fire damage.The flaming blade sheds bright light in a 10-foot
    radius and dim light for an additional 10 feet.
  - At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or
    higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for every two slot levels above 2nd.
