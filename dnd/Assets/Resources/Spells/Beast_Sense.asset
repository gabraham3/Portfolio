  Description:
  - "You touch a willing beast. For the duration of the spell, you can use your action
    to see through the beast\u2019s eyes and hear what it hears, and continue to
    do so until you use your action to return to your normal senses. While perceiving
    through the beast\u2019s senses, you gain the benefits of any special senses
    possessed by that creature, though you are blinded and deafened to your own surroundings."
