  Description:
  - "Lightning springs from your hand to deliver a shock to a creature you try to
    touch. Make a melee spell attack against the target. You have advantage on the
    attack roll if the target is wearing armor made of metal. On a hit, the target
    takes 1d8 lightning damage, and it can\u2019t take reactions until the start
    of its next turn. The spell\u2019s damage increases by 1d8 when you reach 5th
    level (2d8), 11th level (3d8), and 17th level (4d8)."
