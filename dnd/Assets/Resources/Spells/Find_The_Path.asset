  Description:
  - "This spell allows you to find the shortest, most direct physical route to a
    specific fixed location that you are familiar with on the same plane of existence.
    If you name a destination on another plane of existence, a destination that moves
    (such as a mobile fortress), or a destination that isn\u2019t specific (such
    as \u201Ca green dragon\u2019s lair'), the spell fails. For the duration, as
    long as you are on the same plane of existence as the destination, you know how
    far it is and in what direction it lies. While you are traveling there, whenever
    you are presented with a choice of paths along the way, you automatically determine
    which path is the shortest and most direct route (but not necessarily the safest
    route) to the destination."
