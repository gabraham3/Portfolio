  Description:
  - One humanoid of your choice that you can see within range must succeed on a Wisdom
    saving throw or become charmed by you for the duration. While the target is charmed
    in this way, a twisted crown of jagged iron appears on its head, and a madness
    glows in its eyes. The charmed target must use its action before moving on each
    of its turns to make a melee attack against a creature other than itself that
    you mentally choose.The target can act normally on its turn if you choose no
    creature or if none are within its reach. On your subsequent turns, you must
    use your action to maintain control over the target, or the spell ends. Also,
    the target can make a Wisdom saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On
    a success, the spell ends.
