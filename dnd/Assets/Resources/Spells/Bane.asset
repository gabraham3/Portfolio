  - Up to three creatures of your choice that you can see within range must make
    Charisma saving throws. Whenever a target that fails this saving throw makes
    an attack roll or a saving throw before the spell ends, the target must roll
    a d4 and subtract the number rolled from the attack roll or saving throw.
  - At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or
    higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 1st.
