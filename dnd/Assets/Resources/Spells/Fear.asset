  Description:
  - "You project a phantasmal image of a creature\u2019s worst fears. Each creature
    in a 30-foot cone must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or drop whatever it is
    holding and become frightened for the duration. While frightened by this spell,
    a creature must take the Dash action and move away from you by the safest available
    route on each of its turns, unless there is nowhere to move. If the creature
    ends its turn in a location where it doesn\u2019t have line of sight to you,
    the creature can make a Wisdom saving throw. On a successful save, the spell
    ends for that creature."
