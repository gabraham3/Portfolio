  Description:
  - "Choose one creature that you can see within range. The target begins a comic
    dance in place: shuffling, tapping its feet, and capering for the duration. Creatures
    that can\u2019t be charmed are immune to this spell.A dancing creature must use
    all its movement to dance without leaving its space and has disadvantage on Dexterity
    saving throws and attack rolls. While the target is affected by this spell, other
    creatures have advantage on attack rolls against it. As an action, a dancing
    creature makes a Wisdom saving throw to regain control of itself. On a successful
    save, the spell ends."
