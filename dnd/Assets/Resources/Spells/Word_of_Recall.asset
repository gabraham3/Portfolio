  Description:
  - " You and up to five willing creatures within 5 feet of you instantly teleport
    to a previously designated sanctuary. You and any creatures that teleport with
    you appear in the nearest unoccupied space to the spot you designated when you
    prepared your sanctuary (see below). If you cast this spell without first preparing
    a sanctuary, the spell has no effect. You must designate a sanctuary by casting
    this spell within a location, such as a temple, dedicated to or strongly linked
    to your deity. If you attempt to cast the spell in this manner in an area that
    isn\u2019t dedicated to your deity, the spell has no effect."
