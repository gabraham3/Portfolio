  - "You pull wisps of shadow material from the Shadowfell to create a nonliving
    object of vegetable matter within range: soft goods, rope, wood, or something
    similar. You can also use this spell to create mineral objects such as stone,
    crystal, or metal. The object created must be no larger than a 5-foot cube, and
    the object must be of a form and material that you have seen before. The duration
    depends on the object\u2019s material. If the object is composed of multiple
    materials, use the shortest duration. Material  Duration Vegetable matter  1
    day Stone or crystal  12 hours Precious metals  1 hour Gems  10 minutes Adamantine
    or mithral  1 minute Using any material created by this spell as another spell\u2019s
    material component causes that spell to fail."
  - At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or
    higher, the cube increases by 5 feet for each slot level above 5th.
