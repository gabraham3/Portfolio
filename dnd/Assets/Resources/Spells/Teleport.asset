  Description:
  - "This spell instantly transports you and up to eight willing creatures of your
    choice that you can see within range, or a single object that you can see within
    range, to a destination you select. If you target an object, it must be able
    to fit entirely inside a 10-foot cube, and it can\u2019t be held or carried by
    an unwilling creature. The destination you choose must be known to you, and it
    must be on the same plane of existence as you. Your familiarity with the destination
    determines whether you arrive there successfully. The DM rolls d100 and consults
    the table. Familiarity Mishap Permanent circle \u2014 Associated object \u2014

    54-100 74-100 74-100 \u2014 Familiarity. \u201CPermanent circle\u201D means a
    permanent teleportation circle whose sigil sequence you know. \u201CAssociated
    object\u201D means that you possess an object taken from the desired destination
    within the last six months, such as a book from a wizard\u2019s library, bed
    linen from a royal suite, or a chunk of marble from a lich\u2019s secret tomb.
    \u201CVery familiar\u201D is a place you have been very often, a place you have
    carefully studied, or a place you can see when you cast the spell. \u201CSeen
    casually\u201D is someplace you have seen more than once but with which you aren\u2019t
    very familiar. \u201CViewed once\u201D is a place you have seen once, possibly
    using magic. \u201CDescription\u201D is a place whose location and appearance
    you know through someone else\u2019s description, perhaps from a map. \u201CFalse
    destination\u201D is a place that doesn\u2019t exist. Perhaps you tried to scry
    an enemy\u2019s sanctum but instead viewed an illusion, or you are attempting
    to teleport to a familiar location that no longer exists. On Target. You and
    your group (or the target object) appear where you want to. Off Target. You and
    your group (or the target object) appear a random distance away from the destination
    in a random direction. Distance off target is 1d10 x 1d10 percent of the distance
    that was to be traveled. For example, if you tried to travel 120 miles, landed
    off target, and rolled a 5 and 3 on the two d10s, then you would be off target
    by 15 percent, or 18 miles. The DM determines the direction off target randomly
    by rolling a d8 and designating 1 as north, 2 as northeast, 3 as east, and so
    on around the points of the compass. If you were teleporting to a coastal city
    and wound up 18 miles out at sea, you could be in trouble. Similar Area. You
    and your group (or the target object) wind up in a different area that\u2019s
    visually or thematically similar to the target area. If you are heading for your
    home laboratory, for example, you might wind up in another wizard\u2019s laboratory
    or in an alchemical supply shop that has many of the same tools and implements
    as your laboratory. Generally, you appear in the closest similar place, but since
    the spell has no range limit, you could conceivably wind up anywhere on the plane.
    Mishap. The spell\u2019s unpredictable magic results in a difficult journey.
    Each teleporting creature (or the target object) takes 3d10 force damage, and
    the DM rerolls on the table to see where you wind up (multiple mishaps can occur,
    dealing damage each time)."
