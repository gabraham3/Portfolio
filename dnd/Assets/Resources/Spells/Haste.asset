  Description:
  - "Choose a willing creature that you can see within range. Until the spell ends,
    the target\u2019s speed is doubled, it gains a +2 bonus to AC, it has advantage
    on Dexterity saving throws, and it gains an additional action on each of its
    turns. That action can be used only to take the Attack (one weapon attack only),
    Dash, Disengage, Hide, or Use an Object action. When the spell ends, the target
    can\u2019t move or take actions until after its next turn, as a wave of lethargy
    sweeps over it."
