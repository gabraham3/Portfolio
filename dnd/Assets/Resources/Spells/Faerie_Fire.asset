  Description:
  - "Each object in a 20-foot cube within range is outlined in blue, green, or violet
    light (your choice). Any creature in the area when the spell is cast is also
    outlined in light if it fails a Dexterity saving throw. For the duration, objects
    and affected creatures shed dim light in a 10-foot radius. Any attack roll against
    an affected creature or object has advantage if the attacker can see it, and
    the affected creature or object can\u2019t benefit from being invisible."
