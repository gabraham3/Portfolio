  Description:
  - "You manifest a minor wonder, a sign of supernatural power, within range. You
    create one of the following magical effects within range: \u2022 Your voice booms
    up to three times as loud as normal for 1 minute. \u2022 You cause flames to
    flicker, brighten, dim, or change color for 1 minute. \u2022 You cause harmless
    tremors in the ground for 1 minute. \u2022 You create an instantaneous sound
    that originates from a point of your choice within range, such as a rumble of
    thunder, the cry of a raven, or ominous whispers. \u2022 You instantaneously
    cause an unlocked door or win dow to fly open or slam shut. \u2022 You alter
    the appearance of your eyes for 1 minute. If you cast this spell multiple times,
    you can have up to three of its 1-minute effects active at a time, and you can
    dismiss such an effect as an action."
