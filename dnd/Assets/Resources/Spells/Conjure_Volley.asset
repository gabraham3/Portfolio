  Description:
  - You fire a piece of nonmagical ammunition from a ranged weapon or throw a nonmagical
    weapon into the air and choose a point within range. Hundreds of duplicates of
    the ammunition or weapon fall in a volley from above and then disappear. Each
    creature in a 40-foot-radius. 20-foot-high cylinder centered on that point must
    make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 8d8 damage on a failed save,
    or half as much damage on a successful one. The damage type is the same as that
    of the ammunition or weapon.
  Level: 5th-level
