  Description:
  - "Swarming, biting locusts fill a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you
    choose within range. The sphere spreads around corners. The sphere remains for
    the duration, and its area is lightly obscured. The sphere\u2019s area is difficult
    terrain. When the area appears, each creature in it must make a Constitution
    saving throw. A creature takes 4d10 piercing damage on a failed save, or half
    as much damage on a successful one. A creature must also make this saving throw
    when it enters the spell\u2019s area for the first time on a turn or ends its
    turn there."
  - At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or
    higher, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 5th.
  Level: 5th-level
