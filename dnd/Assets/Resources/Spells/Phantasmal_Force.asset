  Description:
  - "You craft an illusion that takes root in the mind of a creature that you can
    see within range. The target must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed
    save, you create a phantasmal object, creature, or other visible phenomenon of
    your choice that is no larger than a 10-foot cube and that is perceivable only
    to the target for the duration. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
    The phantasm includes sound, temperature, and other stimuli, also evident only
    to the creature. The target can use its action to examine the phantasm with an
    Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If the check succeeds,
    the target realizes that the phantasm is an illusion, and the spell ends. While
    a target is affected by the spell, the target treats the phantasm as if it were
    real. The target rationalizes any illogical outcomes from interacting with the
    phantasm. For example, a target attempting to walk across a phantasmal bridge
    that spans a chasm falls once it steps onto the bridge. If the target survives
    the fall, it still believes that the bridge exists and comes up with some other
    explanation for its fall\u2014it was pushed, it slipped, or a strong wind might
    have knocked it off. An affected target is so convinced of the phantasm\u2019s
    reality that it can even take damage from the illusion. A phantasm created to
    appear as a creature can attack the target. Similarly, a phantasm created to
    appear as fire, a pool of acid, or lava can burn the target. Each round on your
    turn, the phantasm can deal 1d6 psychic damage to the target if it is in the
    phantasm\u2019s area or within 5 feet of the phantasm, provided that the illusion
    is of a creature or hazard that could logically deal damage, such as by attacking.
    The target perceives the damage as a type appropriate to the illusion."
