  Description:
  - You speak a word of power that can overwhelm the mind of one creature you can
    see within range, leaving it dumbfounded. If the target has 150 hit points or
    fewer, it is stunned. Otherwise, the spell has no effect. The stunned target
    must make a Constitution saving throw at the end of each of its turns. On a successful
    save, this stunning effect ends.
