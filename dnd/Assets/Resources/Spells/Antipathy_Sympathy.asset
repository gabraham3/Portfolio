  Description:
  - "This spell attracts or repels creatures of your choice. You target something
    within range, either a Huge or smaller object or creature or an area that is
    no larger than a 200-foot cube. Then specify a kind of intelligent creature,
    such as red dragons, goblins, or vampires. You invest the target with an aura
    that either attracts or repels the specified creatures for the duration. Choose
    antipathy or sympathy as the aura\u2019s effect. Antipathy. The enchantment causes
    creatures of the kind you designated to feel an intense urge to leave the area
    and avoid the target. When such a creature can see the target or comes within
    60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or become frightened.
    The creature remains frightened while it can see the target or is within 60 feet
    of it. While frightened by the target, the creature must use its movement to
    move to the nearest safe spot from which it can\u2019t see the target. If the
    creature moves more than 60 feet from the target and can\u2019t see it, the creature
    is no longer frightened, but the creature becomes frightened again if it regains
    sight of the target or moves within 60 feet of it. Sympathy. The enchantment
    causes the specified creatures to feel an intense urge to approach the target
    while within 60 feet of it or able to see it. When such a creature can see the
    target or comes within 60 feet of it, the creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving
    throw or use its movement on each of its turns to enter the area or move within
    reach of the target. When the creature has done so, it can\u2019t willingly move
    away from the target. If the target damages or otherwise harms an affected creature,
    the affected creature can make a Wisdom saving throw to end the effect, as described
    below. Ending the Effect. If an affected creature ends its turn while not within
    60 feet of the target or able to see it, the creature makes a Wisdom saving throw.
    On a successful save, the creature is no longer affected by the target and recognizes
    the feeling of repugnance or attraction as magical. In addition, a creature affected
    by the spell is allowed another Wisdom saving throw every 24 hours while the
    spell persists. A creature that successfully saves against this effect is immune
    to it for 1 minute, after which time it can be affected again."
