  Description:
  - You become invisible at the same time that an illusory  double of you appears
    where you are standing. The  double lasts for the duration, but the invisibility
    ends if  you attack or cast a spell. You can use your action to move your illusory
    double  up to twice your speed and make it gesture, speak, and  behave in whatever
    way you choose. You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears  as if
    you were located where it is. On each of your turns  as a bonus action, you can
    switch from using its senses  to using your own, or back again. While you are
    using its  senses, you are blinded and deafened in regard to your  own surroundings.
