  Description:
  - "You create a magical zone that guards against deception in a 15-foot-radius
    sphere centered on a point of your choice within range. Until the spell ends,
    a creature that enters the spell\u2019s area for the first time on a turn or
    starts its turn there must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save, a
    creature can\u2019t speak a deliberate lie while in the radius. You know whether
    each creature succeeds or fails on its saving throw. An affected creature is
    aware of the spell and can thus avoid answering questions to which it would normally
    respond with a lie. Such a creature can be evasive in its answers as long as
    it remains within the boundaries of the truth."
