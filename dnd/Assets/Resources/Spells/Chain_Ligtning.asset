  Description:
  - You create a bolt of lightning that arcs toward a target of your choice that
    you can see within range. Three bolts then leap from that target to as many as
    three other targets, each of which must be within 30 feet of the first target.
    A target can be a creature or an object and can be targeted by only one of the
    bolts. A target must make a Dexterity saving throw. The target takes 10d8 lightning
    damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
  - At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or
    higher, one additional bolt leaps from the first target to another target for
    each slot level above 6th.
  Level: 6th-level
  score: 0
