  Description:
  - "Choose a manufactured metal object, such as a metal weapon or a suit of heavy
    or medium metal armor, that you can see within range. You cause the object to
    glow red-hot. Any creature in physical contact with the object takes 2d8 fire
    damage when you cast the spell. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action
    on each of your subsequent turns to cause this damage again.If a creature is
    holding or wearing the object and takes the damage from it, the creature must
    succeed on a Constitution saving throw or drop the object if it can. If it doesn\u2019t
    drop the object, it has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks until
    the start of your next turn."
  - At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or
    higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 2nd.
