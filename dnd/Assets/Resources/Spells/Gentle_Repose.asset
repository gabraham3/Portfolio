  Description:
  - "You touch a corpse or other remains. For the duration, the target is protected
    from decay and can\u2019t become undead. The spell also effectively extends the
    time limit on raising the target from the dead, since days spent under the influence
    of this spell don\u2019t count against the time limit of spells such as raise
    dead."
