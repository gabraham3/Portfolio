  Description:
  - "You summon a spirit that assumes the form of an unusually intelligent, strong,
    and loyal steed, creating a long-lasting bond with it. Appearing in an unoccupied
    space within range, the steed takes on a form that you choose, such as a warhorse,
    a pony, a camel, an elk, or a mastiff. (Your DM might allow other animals to
    be summoned as steeds.) The steed has the statistics of the chosen form, though
    it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of its normal type. Additionally,
    if your steed has an Intelligence of 5 or less, its Intelligence becomes 6, and
    it gains the ability to understand one language of your choice that you speak.
    Your steed serves you as a mount, both in combat and out, and you have an instinctive
    bond with it that allows you to fight as a seamless unit. While mounted on your
    steed, you can make any spell you cast that targets only you also target your
    steed. When the steed drops to 0 hit points, it disappears, leaving behind no
    physical form. You can also dismiss your steed at any time as an action, causing
    it to disappear. In either case, casting this spell again summons the same steed,
    restored to its hit point maximum. While your steed is within 1 mile of you,
    you can communicate with it telepathically. You can\u2019t have more than one
    steed bonded by this spell at a time. As an action, you can release the steed
    from its bond at any time, causing it to disappear."
