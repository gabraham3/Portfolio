  Description:
  - "You create an invisible sensor within range in a location familiar to you (a
    place you have visited or seen before) or in an obvious location that is unfamiliar
    to you (such as behind a door, around a corner, or in a grove of trees). The
    sensor remains in place for the duration, and it can\u2019t be attacked or otherwise
    interacted with. When you cast the spell, you choose seeing or hearing. You can
    use the chosen sense through the sensor as if you were in its space. As your
    action, you can switch between seeing and hearing. A creature that can see the
    sensor (such as a creature benefiting from see invisibility or truesight) sees
    a luminous, intangible orb about the size of your fist."
