  Description:
  - " A churning storm cloud forms, centered on a point you can see and spreading
    to a radius of 360 feet. Lightning flashes in the area, thunder booms, and strong
    winds roar. Each creature under the cloud (no more than 5,000 feet beneath the
    cloud) when it appears must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save,
    a creature takes 2d6 thunder damage and becomes deafened for 5 minutes. Each
    round you maintain concentration on this spell, the storm produces additional
    effects on your turn. Round 2. Acidic rain falls from the cloud. Each creature
    and object under the cloud takes 1d6 acid damage. Round 3. You call six bolts
    of lightning from the cloud to strike six creatures or objects of your choice
    beneath the cloud. A given creature or object can\u2019t be struck by more than
    one bolt. A struck creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. The creature
    takes 10d6 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
    one. Round 4. Hailstones rain down from the cloud. Each creature under the cloud
    takes 2d6 bludgeoning damage. Round 5-10. Gusts and freezing rain assail the
    area under the cloud. The area becomes difficult terrain and is heavily obscured.
    Each creature there takes 1d6 cold damage. Ranged weapon attacks in the area
    are impossible. The wind and rain count as a severe distraction for the purposes
    of maintaining concentration on spells. Finally, gusts of strong wind (ranging
    from 20 to 50 miles per hour) automatically disperse fog, mists, and similar
    phenomena in the area, whether mundane or magical."
