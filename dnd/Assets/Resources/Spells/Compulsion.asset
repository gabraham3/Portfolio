  Description:
  - "Creatures of your choice that you can see within range and that can hear you
    must make a Wisdom saving throw. A target automatically succeeds on this saving
    throw if it can\u2019t be charmed. On a failed save, a target is affected by
    this spell. Until the spell ends, you can use a bonus action on each of your
    turns to designate a direction that is horizontal to you. Each affected target
    must use as much of its movement as possible to move in that direction on its
    next turn. It can take its action before it moves. After moving in this way,
    it can make another Wisdom saving to try to end the effect. A target isn\u2019t
    compelled to move into an obviously deadly hazard, such as a fire or pit, but
    it will provoke opportunity attacks to move in the designated direction."
