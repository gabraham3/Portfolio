  Description:
  - "The ground in a 20-foot radius centered on a point within range twists and sprouts
    hard spikes and thorns. The area becomes difficult terrain for the duration.
    When a creature moves into or within the area, it takes 2d4 piercing damage for
    every 5 feet it travels. The transformation of the ground is camouflaged to look
    natural. Any creature that can\u2019t see the area at the time the spell is cast
    must make a Wisdom (Perception) check against your spell save DC to recognize
    the terrain as hazardous before entering it."
