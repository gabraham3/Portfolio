  Description:
  - "This spell channels vitality into plants within a specific area. There are two
    possible uses for the spell, granting either immediate or long-term benefits.
    If you cast this spell using 1 action, choose a point within range. All normal
    plants in a 100-foot radius centered on that point become thick and overgrown.
    A creature moving through the area must spend 4 feet of movement for every 1
    foot it moves. You can exclude one or more areas of any size within the spell\u2019s
    area from being affected. If you cast this spell over 8 hours, you enrich the
    land. All plants in a half-mile radius centered on a point within range become
    enriched for 1 year. The plants yield twice the normal amount of food when harvested."
