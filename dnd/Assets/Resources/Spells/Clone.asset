  Description:
  - "This spell grows an inert duplicate of a living creature as a safeguard against
    death. This clone forms inside a sealed vessel and grows to full size and maturity
    after 120 days; you can also choose to have the clone be a younger version of
    the same creature. It remains inert and endures indefinitely, as long as its
    vessel remains undisturbed. At any time after the clone matures, if the original
    creature dies, its soul transfers to the clone, provided that the soul is free
    and willing to return. The clone is physically identical to the original and
    has the same personality, memories, and abilities, but none of the original\u2019s
    equipment. The original creature\u2019s physical remains, if they still exist,
    become inert and can\u2019t thereafter be restored to life, since the creature\u2019s
    soul is elsewhere."
