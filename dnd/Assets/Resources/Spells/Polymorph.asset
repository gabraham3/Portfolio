  Description:
  - " This spell transforms a creature that you can see within range into a new form.
    An unwilling creature must make a Wisdom saving throw to avoid the effect. A
    shapechanger automatically succeeds on this saving throw.The transformation lasts
    for the duration, or until the target drops to 0 hit points or dies. The new
    form can be any beast whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target\u2019s
    (or the target\u2019s level, if it doesn't have a challenge rating). The target\u2019s
    game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics
    of the chosen beast. It retains its alignment and personality.The target assumes
    the hit points of its new form. When it reverts to its normal form, the creature
    returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts
    as a result of dropping to0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its
    normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn\u2019t reduce the creature\u2019s
    normal form to 0 hit points, it isn\u2019t knocked unconscious.The creature is
    limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can\u2019t
    speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or speech.The
    target\u2019s gear melds into the new form. The creature can\u2019t activate,
    use, wield, or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment."
