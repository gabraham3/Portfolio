  Description:
  - " Drawing on the deepest fears of a group of creatures, you create illusory creatures
    in their minds, visible only to them. Each creature in a 30-foot-radius sphere
    centered on a point of your choice within range must make a Wisdom saving throw.
    On a failed save, a creature becomes frightened for the duration. The illusion
    calls on the creature\u2019s deepest fears, manifesting its worst nightmares
    as an implacable threat. At the start of each of the frightened creature\u2019s
    turns, it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 4d10 psychic damage.
    On a successful save, the spell ends for that creature."
