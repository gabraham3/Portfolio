  Description:
  - ' You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon
    that is no larger than a 15-foot cube. The image appears at a spot within range
    and lasts for the duration. The image is purely visual; it isn''t accompanied
    by sound, smell, or other sensory effects. You can use your action to cause the
    image to move to any spot within range. As the image changes location, you can
    alter its appearance so that its movements appear natural for the image. For
    example, if you create an image of a creature and move it, you can alter the
    image so that it appears to be walking. Physical interaction with the image reveals
    it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature that uses
    its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion with a successful
    Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature
    discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see through the image.'
