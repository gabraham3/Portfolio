  Description:
  - "A Large quasi-real, horselike creature appears on the ground in an unoccupied
    space of your choice within range. You decide the creature\u2019s appearance,
    but it is equipped with a saddle, bit, and bridle. Any of the equipment created
    by the spell vanishes in a puff of smoke if it is carried more than 10 feet away
    from the steed. For the duration, you or a creature you choose can ride the steed.
    The creature uses the statistics for a riding horse, except it has a speed of
    100 feet and can travel 10 miles in an hour, or 13 miles at a fast pace. When
    the spell ends, the steed gradually fades, giving the rider 1 minute to dismount.
    The spell ends if you use an action to dismiss it or if the steed takes any damage."
