  Description:
  - "You convert raw materials into products of the same material. For example, you
    can fabricate a wooden bridge from a clump of trees, a rope from a patch of hemp,
    and clothes from flax or wool. Choose raw materials that you can see within range.
    You can fabricate a Large or smaller object (contained within a 10-foot cube,
    or eight connected 5-foot cubes), given a sufficient quantity of raw material.
    If you are working with metal, stone, or another mineral substance, however,
    the fabricated object can be no larger than Medium (contained within a single
    5-foot cube). The quality of objects made by the spell is commensurate with the
    quality of the raw materials. Creatures or magic items can\u2019t be created
    or transmuted by this spell. You also can\u2019t use it to create items that
    ordinarily require a high degree of craftsmanship, such as jewelry, weapons,
    glass, or armor, unless you have proficiency with the type of artisan\u2019s
    tools used to craft such objects."
