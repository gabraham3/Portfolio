  Description:
  - " You and up to ten willing creatures you can see within range assume a gaseous
    form for the duration, appearing as wisps of cloud. While in this cloud form,
    a creature has a flying speed of 300 feet and has resistance to damage from nonmagical
    weapons. The only actions a creature can take in this form are the Dash action
    or to revert to its normal form. Reverting takes 1 minute, during which time
    a creature is incapacitated and can\u2019t move. Until the spell ends, a creature
    can revert to cloud form, which also requires the 1-minute transformation. If
    a creature is in cloud form and flying when the effect ends, the creature descends
    60 feet per round for 1 minute until it lands, which it does safely. If it can\u2019t
    land after 1 minute, the creature falls the remaining distance."
