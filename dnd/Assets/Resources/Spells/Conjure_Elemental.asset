  Description:
  - "You call forth an elemental servant. Choose an area of air, earth, fire, or
    water that fills a 10-foot cube within range. An elemental of challenge rating
    5 or lower appropriate to the area you chose appears in an unoccupied space within
    10 feet of it. For example, a fire elemental emerges from a bonfire, and an earth
    elemental rises up from the ground. The elemental disappears when it drops to
    0 hit points or when the spell ends. The elemental is friendly to you and your
    companions for the duration. Roll initiative for the elemental, which has its
    own turns. It obeys any verbal commands that you issue to it (no action required
    by you). If you don\u2019t issue any commands to the elemental, it defends itself
    from hostile creatures but otherwise takes no actions. If your concentration
    is broken, the elemental doesn\u2019t disappear. Instead, you lose control of
    the elemental, it becomes hostile toward you and your companions, and it might
    attack. An uncontrolled elemental can\u2019t be dismissed by you, and it disappears
    1 hour after you summoned it. The DM has the elemental\u2019s statistics."
  - At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or
    higher, the challenge rating increases by 1 for each slot level above 5th.
