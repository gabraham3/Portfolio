  Description:
  - "You gain the ability to comprehend and verbally communicate with beasts for
    the duration. The knowledge and awareness of many beasts is limited by their
    intelligence, but at minimum, beasts can give you information about nearby locations
    and monsters, including whatever they can perceive or have perceived within the
    past day. You might be able to persuade a beast to perform a small favor for
    you, at the DM\u2019s discretion."
