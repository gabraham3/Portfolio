  Description:
  - You send negative energy coursing through a creature that you can see within
    range, causing it searing pain. The target must make a Constitution saving throw.
    It takes 7d8 + 30 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on
    a successful one. A humanoid killed by this spell rises at the start of your
    next turn as a zombie that is permanently under your command, following your
    verbal orders to the best of its ability.
