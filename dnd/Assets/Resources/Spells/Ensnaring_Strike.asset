  Description:
  - The next time you hit a creature with a weapon attack before this spell ends,
    a writhing mass of thorny vines appears at the point of impact, and the target
    must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by the magical vines
    until the spell ends. A Large or larger creature has advantage on this saving
    throw. If the target succeeds on the save, the vines shrivel away. While restrained
    by this spell, the target takes 1d6 piercing damage at the start of each of its
    turns. A creature restrained by the vines or one that can touch the creature
    can use its action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a
    success, the target is freed.
  - At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or higher,
    the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
  Level: 1st-level
