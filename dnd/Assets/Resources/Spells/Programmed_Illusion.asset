  Description:
  - ' You create an illusion of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon
    within range that activates when a specific condition occurs. The illusion is
    imperceptible until then. It must be no larger than a 30-foot cube, and you decide
    when you cast the spell how the illusion behaves and what sounds it makes. This
    scripted performance can last up to 5 minutes. When the condition you specify
    occurs, the illusion springs into existence and performs in the manner you described.
    Once the illusion finishes performing, it disappears and remains dormant for
    10 minutes. After this time, the illusion can be activated again. The triggering
    condition can be as general or as detailed as you like, though it must be based
    on visual or audible conditions that occur within 30 feet of the area. For example,
    you could create an illusion of yourself to appear and warn off others who attempt
    to open a trapped door, or you could set the illusion to trigger only when a
    creature says the correct word or phrase. Physical interaction with the image
    reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature
    that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion
    with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save
    DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see
    through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.'
