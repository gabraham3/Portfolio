  Description:
  - "You touch a stone object of Medium size or smaller or a section of stone no
    more than 5 feet in any dimension and form it into any shape that suits your
    purpose. So, for example, you could shape a large rock into a weapon, idol, or
    coffer, or make a small passage through a wall, as long as the wall is less than
    5 feet thick. You could also shape a stone door or its frame to seal the door
    shut. The object you create can have up to two hinges and a latch, but finer
    mechanical detail isn\u2019t possible."
