  Description:
  - "You teleport yourself from your current location to any other spot within range.
    You arrive at exactly the spot desired. It can be a place you can see, one you
    can visualize, or one you can describe by stating distance and direction, such
    as \u201C200 feet straight downward' or \u201Cupward to the northwest at a 45-degree
    angle, 300 feet.' You can bring along objects as long as their weight doesn\u2019t
    exceed what you can carry. You can also bring one willing creature of your size
    or smaller who is carrying gear up to its carrying capacity. The creature must
    be within 5 feet of you when you cast this spell. If you would arrive in a place
    already occupied by an object or a creature, you and any creature traveling with
    you each take 4d6 force damage, and the spell fails to teleport you."
