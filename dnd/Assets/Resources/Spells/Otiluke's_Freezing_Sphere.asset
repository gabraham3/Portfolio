  Description:
  - "A frigid globe of cold energy streaks from your fingertips to a point of your
    choice within range, where it explodes in a 60-foot-radius sphere. Each creature
    within the area must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, a creature
    takes 10d6 cold damage. On a successful save, it takes half as much damage.If
    the globe strikes a body of water or a liquid that is principally water (not
    including water-based creatures), it freezes the liquid to a depth of 6 inches
    over an area 30 feet square. This ice lasts for 1 minute. Creatures that were
    swimming on the surface of frozen water are trapped in the ice. A trapped creature
    can use an action to make a Strength check against your spell save DC to break
    free.You can refrain from firing the globe after completing the spell, if you
    wish. A small globe about the size of a sling stone, cool to the touch, appears
    in your hand.At any time, you or a creature you give the globe to can throw the
    globe (to a range of 40 feet) or hurl it with a sling (to the sling\u2019s normal
    range). It shatters on impact, with the same effect as the normal casting of
    the spell. You can also set the globe down without shattering it. After 1 minute,
    if the globe hasn\u2019t already shattered, it explodes."
  - At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or
    higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 6th.
