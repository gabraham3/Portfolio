  Description:
  - "You summon elementals that appear in unoccupied spaces that you can see within
    range. You choose one the following options for what appears: \u2022 One elemental
    of challenge rating 2 or lower \u2022 Two elementals of challenge rating 1 or
    lower \u2022 Four elementals of challenge rating 1/2 or lower \u2022 Eight elementals
    of challenge rating 1/4 or lower. An elemental summoned by this spell disappears
    when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell ends. The summoned creatures
    are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative for the summoned creatures
    as a group, which has its own turns. They obey any verbal commands that you issue
    to them (no action required by you). If you don\u2019t issue any commands to
    them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but otherwise take no actions.
    The DM has the creatures' statistics."
  - 'At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using certain higher-level spell
    slots, you choose one of the summoning options above, and more creatures appear:
    twice as many with a 6th-level slot and three times as many with an 8th-level
    slot.'
