  Description:
  - "An immobile, invisible, cube-shaped prison composed of magical force springs
    into existence around an area you choose within range. The prison can be a cage
    or a solid box, as you choose. A prison in the shape of a cage can be up to 20
    feet on a side and is made from 1/2-inch diameter bars spaced 1/2 inch apart.
    A prison in the shape of a box can be up to 10 feet on a side, creating a solid
    barrier that prevents any matter from passing through it and blocking any spells
    cast into or out from the area. When you cast the spell, any creature that is
    completely inside the cage's area is trapped. Creatures only partially within
    the area, or those too large to fit inside the area, are pushed away from the
    center of the area until they are completely outside the area. A creature inside
    the cage can\u2019t leave it by nonmagical means. If the creature tries to use
    teleportation or interplanar travel to leave the cage, it must first make a Charisma
    saving throw. On a success, the creature can use that magic to exit the cage.
    On a failure, the creature can't exit the cage and wastes the use of the spell
    or effect. The cage also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking ethereal travel.
    This spell can\u2019t be dispelled by dispel magic."
