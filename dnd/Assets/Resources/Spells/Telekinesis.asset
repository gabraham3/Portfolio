  Description:
  - "You gain the ability to move or manipulate creatures or objects by thought.
    When you cast the spell, and as your action each round for the duration, you
    can exert your will on one creature or object that you can see within range,
    causing the appropriate effect below. You can affect the same target round after
    round, or choose a new one at any time. If you switch targets, the prior target
    is no longer affected by the spell. Creature. You can try to move a Huge or smaller
    creature. Make an ability check with your spellcasting ability contested by the
    creature\u2019s Strength check. If you win the contest, you move the creature
    up to 30 feet in any direction, including upward but not beyond the range of
    this spell. Until the end of your next turn, the creature is restrained in your
    telekinetic grip. A creature lifted upward is suspended in mid-air. On subsequent
    rounds, you can use your action to attempt to maintain your telekinetic grip
    on the creature by repeating the contest. Object. You can try to move an object
    that weighs up to 1,000 pounds. If the object isn\u2019t being worn or carried,
    you automatically move it up to 30 feet in any direction, but not beyond the
    range of this spell. If the object is worn or carried by a creature, you must
    make an ability check with your spellcasting ability contested by that creature\u2019s
    Strength check. If you succeed, you pull the object away from that creature and
    can move it up to 30 feet in any direction but not beyond the range of this spell.
    You can exert fine control on objects with your telekinetic grip, such as manipulating
    a simple tool, opening a door or a container, stowing or retrieving an item from
    an open container, or pouring the contents from a vial."
