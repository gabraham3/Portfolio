  Description:
  - "You create a 10-foot-radius, 20-foot-tall cylinder of magical energy centered
    on a point on the ground that you can see within range. Glowing runes appear
    wherever the cylinder intersects with the floor or other surface. Choose one
    or more of the following types of creatures: celestials, elementals, fey, fiends,
    or undead. The circle affects a creature of the chosen type in the following
    ways: \u2022 The creature can\u2019t willingly enter the cylinder by nonmagical
    means. If the creature tries to use tele portation or interplanar travel to do
    so, it must first succeed on a Charisma saving throw. \u2022 The creature has
    disadvantage on attack rolls against targets within the cylinder. \u2022 Targets
    within the cylinder can\u2019t be charmed, fright ened, or possessed by the creature.When
    you cast this spell, you can elect to cause its magic to operate in the reverse
    direction, preventing a creature of the specified type from leaving the cylinder
    and protecting targets outside it."
  - At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or
    higher, the duration increases by 1 hour for each slot level above 3rd.
