  Description:
  - "A storm cloud appears in the shape of a cylinder that is 10 feet tall with a
    60-foot radius, centered on a point you can see 100 feet directly above you.
    The spell fails if you can\u2019t see a point in the air where the storm cloud
    could appear (for example, if you are in a room that can\u2019t accommodate the
    cloud). When you cast the spell, choose a point you can see within range. A bolt
    of lightning flashes down from the cloud to that point. Each creature within
    5 feet of that point must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d10
    lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one.
    On each of your turns until the spell ends, you can use your action to call down
    lightning in this way again, targeting the same point or a different one. If
    you are outdoors in stormy conditions when you cast this spell, the spell gives
    you control over the existing storm instead of creating a new one. Under such
    conditions, the spell\u2019s damage increases by 1d10."
  - At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th or higher
    level, the damage increases by 1d10 for each slot level above 3rd.
