    an illusory manifestation of its deepest fears, visible only to that creature.
    The target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes
    frightened for the duration. At the start of each of the target\u2019s turns
    before the spell ends, the target must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take
    4d10 psychic damage. On a successful save, the spell ends."
  - At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or
