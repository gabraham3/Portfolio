  Description:
  - "You attempt to turn one creature that you can see within range into stone. If
    the target\u2019s body is made of flesh, the creature must make a Constitution
    saving throw. On a failed save, it is restrained as its flesh begins to harden.
    On a successful save, the creature isn\u2019t affected. A creature restrained
    by this spell must make another Constitution saving throw at the end of each
    of its turns. If it successfully saves against this spell three times, the spell
    ends. If it fails its saves three times, it is turned to stone and subjected
    to the petrified condition for the duration. The successes and failures don\u2019t
    need to be consecutive; keep track of both until the target collects three of
    a kind. If the creature is physically broken while petrified, it suffers from
    similar deformities if it reverts to its original state. If you maintain your
    concentration on this spell for the entire possible duration, the creature is
    turned to stone until the effect is removed."
