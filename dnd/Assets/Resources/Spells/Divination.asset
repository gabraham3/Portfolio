  Description:
  - "Your magic and an offering put you in contact with a god or a god\u2019s servants.
    You ask a single question concerning a specific goal, event, or activity to occur
    within 7 days. The DM offers a truthful reply. The reply might be a short phrase,
    a cryptic rhyme, or an omen. The spell doesn\u2019t take into account any possible
    circumstances that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional
    spells or the loss or gain of a companion. If you cast the spell two or more
    times before finishing your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent
    chance for each casting after the first that you get a random reading. The DM
    makes this roll in secret."
