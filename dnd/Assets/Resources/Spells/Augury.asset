  Description:
  - "By casting gem-inlaid sticks, rolling dragon bones, laying out ornate cards,
    or employing some other divining tool, you receive an omen from an otherworldly
    entity about the results of a specific course of action that you plan to take
    within the next 30 minutes. The DM chooses from the following possible omens:
    \u2022 Weal, for good results \u2022 Woe, for bad results \u2022 Weal and woe,
    for both good and bad results \u2022 Nothing, for results that aren\u2019t especially
    good or bad The spell doesn\u2019t take into account any possible circumstances
    that might change the outcome, such as the casting of additional spells or the
    loss or gain of a companion. If you cast the spell two or more times before completing
    your next long rest, there is a cumulative 25 percent chance for each casting
    after the first that you get a random reading. The DM makes this roll in secret."
