  Description:
  - Grasping weeds and vines sprout from the ground in a 20-foot square starting
    from a point within range. For the duration, these plants turn the ground in
    the area into difficult terrain. A creature in the area when you cast the spell
    must succeed on a Strength saving throw or be restrained by the entangling plants
    until the spell ends. A creature restrained by the plants can use its action
    to make a Strength check against your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.
    When the spell ends, the conjured plants wilt away.
