  School: Conjuration
  Description:
  - "You conjure an extradimensional dwelling in range that lasts for the duration.
    You choose where its one entrance is located. The entrance shimmers faintly and
    is 5 feet wide and 10 feet tall. You and any creature you designate when you
    cast the spell can enter the extradimensional dwelling as long as the portal
    remains open. You can open or close the portal if you are within 30 feet of it.
    While closed, the portal is invisible. Beyond the portal is a magnificent foyer
    with numerous chambers beyond. The atmosphere is clean, fresh, and warm. You
    can create any floor plan you like, but the space can\u2019t exceed 50 cubes,
    each cube being 10 feet on each side. The place is furnished and decorated as
    you choose. It contains sufficient food to serve a nine- course banquet for up
    to 100 people. A staff of 100 near-transparent servants attends all who enter.
    You decide the visual appearance of these servants and their attire. They are
    completely obedient to your orders. Each servant can perform any task a normal
    human servant could perform, but they can\u2019t attack or take any action that
    would directly harm another creature. Thus the servants can fetch things, clean,
    mend, fold clothes, light fires, serve food, pour wine, and so on. The servants
    can go anywhere in the mansion but can\u2019t leave it. Furnishings and other
    objects created by this spell dissipate into smoke if removed from the mansion.
    When the spell ends, any creatures inside the extradimensional space are expelled
    into the open spaces nearest to the entrance."
