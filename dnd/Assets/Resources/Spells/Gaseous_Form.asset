  Description:
  - "You transform a willing creature you touch, along with everything it\u2019s
    wearing and carrying, into a misty cloud for the duration. The spell ends if
    the creature drops to 0 hit points. An incorporeal creature isn\u2019t affected.
    While in this form, the target\u2019s only method of movement is a flying speed
    of 10 feet. The target can enter and occupy the space of another creature. The
    target has resistance to nonmagical damage, and it has advantage on Strength,
    Dexterity, and Constitution saving throws. The target can pass through small
    holes, narrow openings, and even mere cracks, though it treats liquids as though
    they were solid surfaces. The target can't fall and remains hovering in the air
    even when stunned or otherwise incapacitated. While in the form of a misty cloud,
    the target can\u2019t talk or manipulate objects, and any objects it was carrying
    or holding can\u2019t be dropped, used, or otherwise interacted with. The target
    can\u2019t attack or cast spells."
