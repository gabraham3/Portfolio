  Description:
  - "You suggest a course of activity (limited to a sentence or two) and magically
    influence up to twelve creatures of your choice that you can see within range
    and that can hear and understand you. Creatures that can\u2019t be charmed are
    immune to this effect. The suggestion must be worded in such a manner as to make
    the course of action sound reasonable. Asking the creature to stab itself, throw
    itself onto a spear, immolate itself, or do some other obviously harmful act
    automatically negates the effect of the spell. Each target must make a Wisdom
    saving throw. On a failed save, it pursues the course of action you described
    to the best of its ability. The suggested course of action can continue for the
    entire duration. If the suggested activity can be completed in a shorter time,
    the spell ends when the subject finishes what it was asked to do. You can also
    specify conditions that will trigger a special activity during the duration.
    For example, you might suggest that a group of soldiers give all their money
    to the first beggar they meet. If the condition isn\u2019t met before the spell
    ends, the activity isn\u2019t performed. If you or any of your companions damage
    a creature affected by this spell, the spell ends for that creature."
  - At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a 7th-level spell slot, the
    duration is 10 days. When you use an 8th-level spell slot, the duration is 30
    days. When you use a 9th-level spell slot, the duration is a year and a day.
