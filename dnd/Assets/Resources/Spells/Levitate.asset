  Description:
  - "One creature or object of your choice that you can see  within range rises vertically,
    up to 20 feet, and remains  suspended there for the duration. The spell can levitate 
    a target that weighs up to 500 pounds. An unwilling  creature that succeeds on
    a Constitution saving throw  is unaffected. The target can move only by pushing
    or pulling  against a fixed object or surface within reach (such as  a wall or
    a ceiling), which allows it to move as if it were  climbing. You can change the
    target\u2019s altitude by up to  20 feet in either direction on your turn. If
    you are the  target, you can move up or down as part of your move.  Otherwise,
    you can use your action to move the target,  which must remain within the spell\u2019s
    range. When the spell ends, the target floats gently to the  ground if it is
    still aloft."
