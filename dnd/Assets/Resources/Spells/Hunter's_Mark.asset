  Description:
  - You choose a creature you can see within range and mystically mark it as your
    quarry. Until the spell ends, you deal an extra 1d6 damage to the target whenever
    you hit it with a weapon attack, and you have advantage on any Wisdom (Perception)
    or Wisdom (Survival) check you make to find it. If the target drops to 0 hit
    points before this spell ends, you can use a bonus action on a subsequent turn
    of yours to mark a new creature.
  - At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd or 4th level,
    you can maintain your concentration on the spell for up to 8 hours. When you
    use a spell slot of 5th level or higher, you can maintain your concentration
    on the spell for up to 24 hours.
