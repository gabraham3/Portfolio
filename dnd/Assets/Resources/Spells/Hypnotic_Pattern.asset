  Description:
  - You create a twisting pattern of colors that weaves through the air inside a
    30-foot cube within range. The pattern appears for a moment and vanishes. Each
    creature in the area who sees the pattern must make a Wisdom saving throw. On
    a failed save, the creature becomes charmed for the duration. While charmed by
    this spell, the creature is incapacitated and has a speed of 0. The spell ends
    for an affected creature if it takes any damage or if someone else uses an action
    to shake the creature out of its stupor.
