  Description:
  - "You make terrain in an area up to 1 mile square look, sound, smell, and even
    feel like some other sort of terrain. The terrain\u2019s general shape remains
    the same, however. Open fields or a road could be made to resemble a swamp, hill,
    crevasse, or some other difficult or impassable terrain. A pond can be made to
    seem like a grassy meadow, a precipice like a gentle slope, or a rock-strewn
    gully like a wide and smooth road. Similarly, you can alter the appearance of
    structures, or add them where none are present. The spell doesn\u2019t disguise,
    conceal, or add creatures. The illusion includes audible, visual, tactile, and
    olfactory elements, so it can turn clear ground into difficult terrain (or vice
    versa) or otherwise impede movement through the area. Any piece of the illusory
    terrain (such as a rock or stick) that is removed from the spell\u2019s area
    disappears immediately. Creatures with truesight can see through the illusion
    to the terrain\u2019s true form; however, all other elements of the illusion
    remain, so while the creature is aware of the illusion\u2019s presence, the creature
    can still physically interact with the illusion."
