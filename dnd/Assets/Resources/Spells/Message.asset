  Description:
  - "You point your finger toward a creature within range and whisper a message.
    The target (and only the target) hears the message and can reply in a whisper
    that only you can hear. You can cast this spell through solid objects if you
    are familiar with the target and know it is beyond the barrier. Magical silence.
    1 foot of stone, 1 inch of common metal, a thin sheet of lead, or 3 feet of wood
    blocks the spell. The spell doesn\u2019t have to follow a straight line and can
    travel freely around corners or through openings."
