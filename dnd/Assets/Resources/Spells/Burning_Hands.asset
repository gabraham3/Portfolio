  Description:
  - "As you hold your hands with thumbs touching and fingers spread, a thin sheet
    of flames shoots forth from your outstretched fingertips. Each creature in a
    15-foot cone must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 3d6 fire damage
    on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. The fire ignites
    any flammable objects in the area that aren\u2019t being worn or carried."
  - At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or
    higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
