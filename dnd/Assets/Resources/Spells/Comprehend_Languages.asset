  Description:
  - "For the duration, you understand the literal meaning of any spoken language
    that you hear. You also understand any written language that you see, but you
    must be touching the surface on which the words are written. It takes about 1
    minute to read one page of text. This spell doesn\u2019t decode secret messages
    in a text or a glyph, such as an arcane sigil, that isn\u2019t part of a written
    language."
