  Description:
  - For the duration, no sound can be created within or pass through a 20-foot-radius
    sphere centered on a point you choose within range. Any creature or object entirely
    inside the sphere is immune to thunder damage, and creatures are deafened while
    entirely inside it. Casting a spell that includes a verbal component is impossible
    there.
  Level: 2nd-level
