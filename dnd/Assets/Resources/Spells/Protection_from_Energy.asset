  Description:
  - " Until the spell ends, one willing creature you touch is protected against certain
    types of creatures: aberrations, celestials, elementals, fey, fiends, and undead.
    The protection grants several benefits. Creatures of those types have disadvantage
    on attack rolls against the target. The target also can\u2019t be charmed, frightened,
    or possessed by them. If the target is already charmed, frightened, or possessed
    by such a creature, the target has advantage on any new saving throw against
    the relevant effect."
