  Description:
  - "You unleash a virulent disease on a creature that you can see within range.
    The target must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed save, it takes
    14d6 necrotic damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. The damage
    can\u2019t reduce the target\u2019s hit points below 1. If the target fails the
    saving throw, its hit point maximum is reduced for 1 hour by an amount equal
    to the necrotic damage it took. Any effect that removes a disease allows a creature\u2019s
    hit point maximum to return to normal before that time passes."
