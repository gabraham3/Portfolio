  Description:
  - "You briefly become one with nature and gain knowledge of the surrounding territory.
    In the outdoors, the spell gives you knowledge of the land within 3 miles of
    you. In caves and other natural underground settings, the radius is limited to
    300 feet. The spell doesn\u2019t function where nature has been replaced by construction,
    such as in dungeons and towns. You instantly gain knowledge of up to three facts
    of your choice about any of the following subjects as they relate to the area:
    \u2022 terrain and bodies of water \u2022 prevalent plants, minerals, animals,
    or peoples \u2022 powerful celestials, fey, fiends, elementals, or undead \u2022
    influence from other planes of existence \u2022 buildings For example, you could
    determine the location of powerful undead in the area, the location of major
    sources of safe drinking water, and the location of any nearby towns."
