  Description:
  - "For the duration, you have advantage on all Charisma checks directed at one
    creature of your choice that isn\u2019t hostile toward you. When the spell ends,
    the creature realizes that you used magic to influence its mood and becomes hostile
    toward you. A creature prone to violence might attack you. Another creature might
    seek retribution in other ways (at the DM\u2019s discretion), depending on the
    nature of your interaction with it."
