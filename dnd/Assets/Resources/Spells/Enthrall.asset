  Description:
  - "You weave a distracting string of words, causing creatures of your choice that
    you can see within range and that can hear you to make a Wisdom saving throw.
    Any creature that can\u2019t be charmed succeeds on this saving throw automatically,
    and if you or your companions are fighting a creature, it has advantage on the
    save. On a failed save, the target has disadvantage on Wisdom (Perception) checks
    made to perceive any creature other than you until the spell ends or until the
    target can no longer hear you. The spell ends if you are incapacitated or can
    no longer speak."
