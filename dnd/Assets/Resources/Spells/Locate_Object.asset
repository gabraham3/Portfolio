  Description:
  - "Describe or name an object that is familiar to you. You sense the direction
    to the object\u2019s location, as long as that object is within 1,000 feet of
    you. If the object is in motion, you know the direction of its movement. The
    spell can locate a specific object known to you, as long as you have seen it
    up close\u2014within 30 feet\u2014at least once. Alternatively, the spell can
    locate the nearest object of a particular kind, such as a certain kind of apparel,
    jewelry, furniture, tool, or weapon. This spell can\u2019t locate an object if
    any thickness of lead, even a thin sheet, blocks a direct path between you and
    the object."
