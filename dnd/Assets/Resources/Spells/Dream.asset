  Description:
  - "This spell shapes a creature\u2019s dreams. Choose a creature known to you as
    the target of this spell. The target must be on the same plane of existence as
    you. Creatures that don\u2019t sleep, such as elves, can\u2019t be contacted
    by this spell. You, or a willing creature you touch, enters a trance state, acting
    as a messenger. While in the trance, the messenger is aware of his or her surroundings,
    but can\u2019t take actions or move. If the target is asleep, the messenger appears
    in the target\u2019s dreams and can converse with the target as long as it remains
    asleep, through the duration of the spell. The messenger can also shape the environment
    of the dream, creating landscapes, objects, and other images. The messenger can
    emerge from the trance at any time, ending the effect of the spell early. The
    target recalls the dream perfectly upon waking. If the target is awake when you
    cast the spell, the messenger knows it, and can either end the trance (and the
    spell) or wait for the target to fall asleep, at which point the messenger appears
    in the target\u2019s dreams. You can make the messenger appear monstrous and
    terrifying to the target. If you do, the messenger can deliver a message of no
    more than ten words and then the target must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a
    failed save, echoes of the phantasmal monstrosity spawn a nightmare that lasts
    the duration of the target\u2019s sleep and prevents the target from gaining
    any benefit from that rest. In addition, when the target wakes up, it takes 3d6
    psychic damage. If you have a body part, lock of hair, clipping from a nail,
    or similar portion of the target\u2019s body, the target makes its saving throw
    with disadvantage."
