  Description:
  - "You sense the presence of any trap within range that is within line of sight.
    A trap, for the purpose of this spell, includes anything that would inflict a
    sudden or unexpected effect you consider harmful or undesirable, which was specifically
    intended as such by its creator. Thus, the spell would sense an area affected
    by the alarm spell, a glyph of warding, or a mechanical pit trap, but it would
    not reveal a natural weakness in the floor, an unstable ceiling, or a hidden
    sinkhole. This spell merely reveals that a trap is present. You don\u2019t learn
    the location of each trap, but you do learn the general nature of the danger
    posed by a trap you sense."
