  Description:
  - "A beam of brilliant light flashes out from your hand in a 5-foot-wide, 60-foot-long
    line. Each creature in the line must make a Constitution saving throw. On a failed
    save, a creature takes 6d8 radiant damage and is blinded until your next turn.
    On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn\u2019t blinded by
    this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw. You can
    create a new line of radiance as your action on any turn until the spell ends.
    For the duration, a mote of brilliant radiance shines in your hand. It sheds
    bright light in a 30-foot radius and dim light for an additional 30 feet. This
    light is sunlight."
