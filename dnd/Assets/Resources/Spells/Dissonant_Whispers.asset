  Description:
  - "You whisper a discordant melody that only one creature of your choice within
    range can hear, wracking it with terrible pain. The target must make a Wisdom
    saving throw. On a failed save, it takes 3d6 psychic damage and must immediately
    use its reaction, if available, to move as far as its speed allows away from
    you. The creature doesn\u2019t move into obviously dangerous ground, such as
    a fire or a pit. On a successful save, the target takes half as much damage and
    doesn\u2019t have to move away. A deafened creature automatically succeeds on
    the save."
  - At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or
    higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
