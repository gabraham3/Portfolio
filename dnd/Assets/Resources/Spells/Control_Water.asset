  Description:
  - "Until the spell ends, you control any freestanding water inside an area you
    choose that is a cube up to 100 feet on a side. You can choose from any of the
    following effects when you cast this spell. As an action on your turn, you can
    repeat the same effect or choose a different one. Flood. You cause the water
    level of all standing water in the area to rise by as much as 20 feet. If the
    area includes a shore, the flooding water spills over onto dry land. If you choose
    an area in a large body of water, you instead create a 20-foot tall wave that
    travels from one side of the area to the other and then crashes down. Any Huge
    or smaller vehicles in the wave\u2019s path are carried with it to the other
    side. Any Huge or smaller vehicles struck by the wave have a 25 percent chance
    of capsizing. The water level remains elevated until the spell ends or you choose
    a different effect. If this effect produced a wave, the wave repeats on the start
    of your next turn while the flood effect lasts. Part Water. You cause water in
    the area to move apart and create a trench. The trench extends across the spell\u2019s
    area, and the separated water forms a wall to either side. The trench remains
    until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. The water then slowly
    fills in the trench over the course of the next round until the normal water
    level is restored. Redirect Flow. You cause flowing water in the area to move
    in a direction you choose, even if the water has to flow over obstacles, up walls,
    or in other unlikely directions. The water in the area moves as you direct it,
    but once it moves beyond the spell\u2019s area, it resumes its flow based on
    the terrain conditions. The water continues to move in the direction you chose
    until the spell ends or you choose a different effect. Whirlpool. This effect
    requires a body of water at least 50 feet square and 25 feet deep. You cause
    a whirlpool to form in the center of the area. The whirlpool forms a vortex that
    is 5 feet wide at the base, up to 50 feet wide at the top, and 25 feet tall.
    Any creature or object in the water and within 25 feet of the vortex is pulled
    10 feet toward it. A creature can swim away from the vortex by making a Strength
    (Athletics) check against your spell save DC. When a creature enters the vortex
    for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there, it must make a Strength
    saving throw. On a failed save, the creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and
    is caught in the vortex until the spell ends. On a successful save, the creature
    takes half damage, and isn\u2019t caught in the vortex. A creature caught in
    the vortex can use its action to try to swim away from the vortex as described
    above, but has disadvantage on the Strength (Athletics) check to do so. The first
    time each turn that an object enters the vortex, the object takes 2d8 bludgeoning
    damage; this damage occurs each round it remains in the vortex."
