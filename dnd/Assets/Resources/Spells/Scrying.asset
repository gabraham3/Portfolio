  Description:
  - "You can see and hear a particular creature you choose that is on the same plane
    of existence as you. The target must make a Wisdom saving throw, which is modified
    by how well you know the target and the sort of physical connection you have
    to it. If a target knows you're casting this spell, it can fail the saving throw
    voluntarily if it wants to be observed. Knowledge Secondhand (you have heard
    of the target) Firsthand (you have met the target) Familiar (you know the target
    well) Connection Likeness or picture Possession or garment Body part, lock of
    hair, bit of nail, or the like Save Modifier +5 +0-5 Save Modifier-2-4-10 On
    a successful save, the target isn\u2019t affected, and you can\u2019t use this
    spell against it again for 24 hours. On a failed save, the spell creates an invisible
    sensor within 10 feet of the target. You can see and hear through the sensor
    as if you were there. The sensor moves with the target, remaining within 10 feet
    of it for the duration. A creature that can see invisible objects sees the sensor
    as a luminous orb about the size of your fist. Instead of targeting a creature,
    you can choose a location you have seen before as the target of this spell. When
    you do, the sensor appears at that location and doesn\u2019t move."
