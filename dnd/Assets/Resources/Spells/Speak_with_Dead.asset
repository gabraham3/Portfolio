  Description:
  - " You grant the semblance of life and intelligence to a corpse of your choice
    within range, allowing it to answer the questions you pose. The corpse must still
    have a mouth and can\u2019t be undead. The spell fails if the corpse was the
    target of this spell within the last 10 days. Until the spell ends, you can ask
    the corpse up to five questions. The corpse knows only what it knew in life,
    including the languages it knew. Answers are usually brief, cryptic, or repetitive,
    and the corpse is under no compulsion to offer a truthful answer if you are hostile
    to it or it recognizes you as an enemy. This spell doesn\u2019t return the creature\u2019s
    soul to its body, only its animating spirit. Thus, the corpse can\u2019t learn
    new information, doesn\u2019t comprehend anything that has happened since it
    died, and can\u2019t speculate about future events."
