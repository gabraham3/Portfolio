  Description:
  - "You create a vertical wall of whirling, razor-sharp blades made of magical energy.
    The wall appears within range and lasts for the duration. You can make a straight
    wall up to 100 feet long, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick, or a ringed wall up
    to 60 feet in diameter, 20 feet high, and 5 feet thick. The wall provides three-quarters
    cover to creatures behind it, and its space is difficult terrain. When a creature
    enters the wall\u2019s area for the first time on a turn or starts its turn there,
    the creature must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the creature
    takes 6d10 slashing damage. On a successful save, the creature takes half as
    much damage."
