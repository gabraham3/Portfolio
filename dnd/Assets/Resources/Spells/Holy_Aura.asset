  Description:
  - Divine light washes out from you and coalesces in a soft radiance in a 30-foot
    radius around you. Creatures of your choice in that radius when you cast this
    spell shed dim light in a 5-foot radius and have advantage on all saving throws,
    and other creatures have disadvantage on attack rolls against them until the
    spell ends. In addition, when a fiend or an undead hits an affected creature
    with a melee attack, the aura flashes with brilliant light. The attacker must
    succeed on a Constitution saving throw or be blinded until the spell ends.
