  Description:
  - You touch a closed door, window, gate, chest, or other entryway, and it becomes
    locked for the duration. You and the creatures you designate when you cast this
    spell can open the object normally. You can also set a password that, when spoken
    within 5 feet of the object, suppresses this spell for 1 minute. Otherwise, it
    is impassable until it is broken or the spell is dispelled or suppressed. Casting
    knock on the object suppresses arcane lock for 10 minutes. While affected by
    this spell, the object is more difficult to break or force open; the DC to break
    it or pick any locks on it increases by 10.
