  Description:
  - "You make an area within range magically secure. The area is a cube that can
    be as small as 5 feet to as large as 100 feet on each side. The spell lasts for
    the duration or until you use an action to dismiss it. When you cast the spell,
    you decide what sort of security the spell provides, choosing any or all of the
    following properties: \u2022 Sound can't pass through the barrier at the edge
    of the warded area. \u2022 The barrier of the warded area appears dark and foggy,
    preventing vision (including darkvision) through it. \u2022 Sensors created by
    divination spells can\u2019t appear inside the protected area or pass through
    the barrier at its perimeter. \u2022 Creatures in the area can\u2019t be targeted
    by divination spells. \u2022 Nothing can teleport into or out of the warded area.
    \u2022 Planar travel is blocked within the warded area. Casting this spell on
    the same spot every day for a year makes this effect permanent."
  - At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or
    higher, you can increase the size of the cube by 100 feet for each slot level
    beyond 4th. Thus you could protect a cube that can be up to 200 feet on one side
    by using a spell slot of 5th level.
