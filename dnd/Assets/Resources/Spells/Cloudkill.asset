  Description:
  - "You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of poisonous, yellow- green fog centered
    on a point you choose within range. The fog spreads around corners. It lasts
    for the duration or until strong wind disperses the fog, ending the spell. Its
    area is heavily obscured. When a creature enters the spell\u2019s area for the
    first time on a turn or starts its turn there, that creature must make a Constitution
    saving throw. The creature takes 5d8 poison damage on a failed save, or half
    as much damage on a successful one. Creatures are affected even if they hold
    their breath or don\u2019t need to breathe. The fog moves 10 feet away from you
    at the start of each of your turns, rolling along the surface of the ground.
    The vapors, being heavier than air, sink to the lowest level of the land, even
    pouring down openings."
  - 'At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or
    higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 5th. '
  Level: 5th-level
