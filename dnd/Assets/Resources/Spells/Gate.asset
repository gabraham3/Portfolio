  Description:
  - "You conjure a portal linking an unoccupied space you can see within range to
    a precise location on a different plane of existence. The portal is a circular
    opening, which you can make 5 to 20 feet in diameter. You can orient the portal
    in any direction you choose. The portal lasts for the duration. The portal has
    a front and a back on each plane where it appears. Travel through the portal
    is possible only by moving through its front. Anything that does so is instantly
    transported to the other plane, appearing in the unoccupied space nearest to
    the portal. Deities and other planar rulers can prevent portals created by this
    spell from opening in their presence or anywhere within their domains. When you
    cast this spell, you can speak the name of a specific creature (a pseudonym,
    title, or nickname doesn\u2019t work). If that creature is on a plane other than
    the one you are on, the portal opens in the named creature\u2019s immediate vicinity
    and draws the creature through it to the nearest unoccupied space on your side
    of the portal. You gain no special power over the creature, and it is free to
    act as the DM deems appropriate. It might leave, attack you, or help you."
