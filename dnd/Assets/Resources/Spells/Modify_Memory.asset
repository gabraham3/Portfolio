  Description:
  - "You attempt to reshape another creature\u2019s memories. One creature that you
    can see must make a Wisdom saving throw. If you are fighting the creature, it
    has advantage on the saving throw. On a failed save, the target becomes charmed
    by you for the duration. The charmed target is incapacitated and unaware of its
    surroundings, though it can still hear you. If it takes any damage or is targeted
    by another spell, this spell ends, and none of the target\u2019s memories are
    modified. While this charm lasts, you can affect the target\u2019s memory of
    an event that it experienced within the last 24 hours and that lasted no more
    than 10 minutes. You can permanently eliminate all memory of the event, allow
    the target to recall the event with perfect clarity and exacting detail, change
    its memory of the details of the event, or create a memory of some other event.
    You must speak to the target to describe how its memories are affected, and it
    must be able to understand your language for the modified memories to take root.
    Its mind fills in any gaps in the details of your description. If the spell ends
    before you have finished describing the modified memories, the creature\u2019s
    memory isn\u2019t altered. Otherwise, the modified memories take hold when the
    spell ends. A modified memory doesn\u2019t necessarily affect how a creature
    behaves, particularly if the memory contradicts the creature\u2019s natural inclinations,
    alignment, or beliefs. An illogical modified memory, such as implanting a memory
    of how much the creature enjoyed dousing itself in acid, is dismissed, perhaps
    as a bad dream. The DM might deem a modified memory too nonsensical to affect
    a creature in a significant manner. A remove curse or greater restoration spell
    cast on the target restores the creature\u2019s true memory."
  - "At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or
    higher, you can alter the target\u2019s memories of an event that took place
    up to 7 days ago (6th level), 30 days ago (7th level), 1 year ago (8th level),
    or any time in the creature\u2019s past (9th level)."
