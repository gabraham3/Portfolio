  Description:
  - "A wall of water springs into existence at a point you choose within range. You
    can make the wall up to 300 feet long, 300 feet high, and 50 feet thick. The
    wall lasts for the duration. When the wall appears, each creature within its
    area must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a creature takes 6d10
    bludgeoning damage, or half as much damage on a successful save. At the start
    of each of your turns after the wall appears, the wall, along with any creatures
    in it, moves 50 feet away from you. Any Huge or smaller creature inside the wall
    or whose space the wall enters when it moves must succeed on a Strength saving
    throw or take 5d10 bludgeoning damage. A creature can take this damage only once
    per round. At the end of the turn, the wall\u2019s height is reduced by 50 feet,
    and the damage creatures take from the spell on subsequent rounds is reduced
    by 1d10. When the wall reaches 0 feet in height, the spell ends. A creature caught
    in the wall can move by swimming. Because of the force of the wave, though, the
    creature must make a successful Strength (Athletics) check against your spell
    save DC in order to move at all. If it fails the check, it can\u2019t move. A
    creature that moves out of the area falls to the ground."
