  Description:
  - A bright streak flashes from your pointing finger to a point you choose within
    range and then blossoms with a low roar into an explosion of flame. Each creature
    in a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on that point must make a Dexterity saving
    throw. A target takes 8d6 fire damage on a failed save, or half as much damage
    on a successful one. The fire spreads around corners. It ignites flammable objects
    in the area that aren't being worn or carried.
  - At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or
    higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 3rd.
  Level: 3rd-level
