  Description:
  - "You gain the service of a familiar, a spirit that takes an animal form you choose:
    bat, cat, crab, frog (toad), hawk, lizard, octopus, owl, poisonous snake, fish
    (quipper), rat, raven, sea horse, spider, or weasel. Appearing in an unoccupied
    space within range, the familiar has the statistics of the chosen form, though
    it is a celestial, fey, or fiend (your choice) instead of a beast. Your familiar
    acts independently of you, but it always obeys your commands. In combat, it rolls
    its own initiative and acts on its own turn. A familiar can\u2019t attack, but
    it can take other actions as normal. When the familiar drops to 0 hit points,
    it disappears, leaving behind no physical form. It reappears after you cast this
    spell again While your familiar is within 100 feet of you, you can communicate
    with it telepathically. Additionally, as an action, you can see through your
    familiar\u2019s eyes and hear what it hears until the start of your next turn,
    gaining the benefits of any special senses that the familiar has. During this
    time, you are deaf and blind with regard to your own senses. As an action, you
    can temporarily dismiss your familiar. It disappears into a pocket dimension
    where it awaits your summons. Alternatively, you can dismiss it forever. As an
    action while it is temporarily dismissed, you can cause it to reappear in any
    unoccupied space within 30 feet of you. You can\u2019t have more than one familiar
    at a time. If you cast this spell while you already have a familiar, you instead
    cause it to adopt a new form. Choose one of the forms from the above list. Your
    familiar transforms into the chosen creature. Finally, when you cast a spell
    with a range of touch, your familiar can deliver the spell as if it had cast
    the spell. Your familiar must be within 100 feet of you, and it must use its
    reaction to deliver the spell when you cast it. If the spell requires an attack
    roll, you use your attack modifier for the roll."
