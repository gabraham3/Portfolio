  Description:
  - "You place an illusion on a creature or an object you touch so that divination
    spells reveal false information about it. The target can be a willing creature
    or an object that isn\u2019t being carried or worn by another creature.When you
    cast the spell, choose one or both of the following effects. The effect lasts
    for the duration. If you cast this spell on the same creature or object every
    day for 30 days, placing the same effect on it each time, the illusion lasts
    until it is dispelled.False Aura. You change the way the target appears to spells
    and magical effects, such as detect magic, that detect magical auras. You can
    make a nonmagical object appear magical, a magical object appear nonmagical,
    or change the object\u2019s magical aura so that it appears to belong to a specific
    school of magic that you choose. When you use this effect on an object, you can
    make the false magic apparent to any creature that handles the item.Mask. You
    change the way the target appears to spells and magical effects that detect creature
    types, such as a paladin\u2019s Divine Sense or the trigger of a symbol spell.
    You choose a creature type and other spells and magical effects treat the target
    as if it were a creature of that type or of that alignment."
