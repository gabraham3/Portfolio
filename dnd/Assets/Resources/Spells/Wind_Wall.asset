  Description:
  - " A wall of strong wind rises from the ground at a point you choose within range.
    You can make the wall up to 50 feet long, 15 feet high, and 1 foot thick. You
    can shape the wall in any way you choose so long as it makes one continuous path
    along the ground. The wall lasts for the duration. When the wall appears, each
    creature within its area must make a Strength saving throw. A creature takes
    3d8 bludgeoning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
    one. The strong wind keeps fog, smoke, and other gases at bay. Small or smaller
    flying creatures or objects can\u2019t pass through the wall. Loose, lightweight
    materials brought into the wall fly upward. Arrows, bolts, and other ordinary
    projectiles launched at targets behind the wall are deflected upward and automatically
    miss. (Boulders hurled by giants or siege engines, and similar projectiles, are
    unaffected.) Creatures in gaseous form can\u2019t pass through it."
