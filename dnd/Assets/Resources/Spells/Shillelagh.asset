  Description:
  - "The wood of a club or quarterstaff you are holding is imbued with nature\u2019s
    power. For the duration, you can use your spellcasting ability instead of Strength
    for the attack and damage rolls of melee attacks using that weapon, and the weapon's
    damage die becomes a d8. The weapon also becomes magical, if it isn\u2019t already.
    The spell ends if you cast it again or if you let go of the weapon."
