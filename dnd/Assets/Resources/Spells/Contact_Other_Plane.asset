  Description:
  - "You mentally contact a demigod, the spirit of a long-dead sage, or some other
    mysterious entity from another plane. Contacting this extraplanar intelligence
    can strain or even break your mind. When you cast this spell, make a DC 15 Intelligence
    saving throw. On a failure, you take 6d6 psychic damage and are insane until
    you finish a long rest. While insane, you can\u2019t take actions, can\u2019t
    understand what other creatures say, can\u2019t read, and speak only in gibberish.
    A greater restoration spell cast on you ends this effect. On a successful save,
    you can ask the entity up to five questions. You must ask your questions before
    the spell ends. The DM answers each question with one word, such as \u201Cyes,'
    \u201Cno,' \u201Cmaybe,' \u201Cnever,' \u201Cirrelevant,' or \u201Cunclear' (if
    the entity doesn\u2019t know the answer to the question). If a one-word answer
    would be misleading, the DM might instead offer a short phrase as an answer."
