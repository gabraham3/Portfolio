  Description:
  - "A silvery beam of pale light shines down in a 5-foot- radius, 40-foot-high cylinder
    centered on a point within range. Until the spell ends, dim light fills the cylinder.
    When a creature enters the spell\u2019s area for the first time on a turn or
    starts its turn there, it is engulfed in ghostly flames that cause searing pain,
    and it must make a Constitution saving throw. It takes 2d10 radiant damage on
    a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. A shapechanger makes
    its saving throw with disadvantage. If it fails, it also instantly reverts to
    its original form and can\u2019t assume a different form until it leaves the
    spell\u2019s light. On each of your turns after you cast this spell, you can
    use an action to move the beam 60 feet in any direction."
  - At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or
    higher, the damage increases by 1dlO for each slot level above 2nd.
