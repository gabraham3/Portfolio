  Description:
  - "Brilliant sunlight flashes in a 60-foot radius centered on a point you choose
    within range. Each creature in that light must make a Constitution saving throw.
    On a failed save, a creature takes 12d6 radiant damage and is blinded for 1 minute.
    On a successful save, it takes half as much damage and isn\u2019t blinded by
    this spell. Undead and oozes have disadvantage on this saving throw. A creature
    blinded by this spell makes another Constitution saving throw at the end of each
    of its turns. On a successful save, it is no longer blinded. This spell dispels
    any darkness in its area that was created by a spell."
