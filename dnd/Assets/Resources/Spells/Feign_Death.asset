  Description:
  - "You touch a willing creature and put it into a cataleptic state that is indistinguishable
    from death. For the spell\u2019s duration, or until you use an action to touch
    the target and dismiss the spell, the target appears dead to all outward inspection
    and to spells used to determine the target\u2019s status. The target is blinded
    and incapacitated, and its speed drops to 0. The target has resistance to all
    damage except psychic damage. If the target is diseased or poisoned when you
    cast the spell, or becomes diseased or poisoned while under the spell\u2019s
    effect, the disease and poison have no effect until the spell ends."
