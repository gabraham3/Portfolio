  Description:
  - "Name or describe a person, place, or object. The spell brings to your mind a
    brief summary of the significant lore about the thing you named. The lore might
    consist of current tales, forgotten stories, or even secret lore that has never
    been widely known. If the thing you named isn\u2019t of legendary importance,
    you gain no information. The more information you already have about the thing,
    the more precise and detailed the information you receive is. The information
    you learn is accurate but might be couched in figurative language. For example,
    if you have a mysterious magic axe on hand, the spell might yield this information:
    'Woe to the evildoer whose hand touches the axe, for even the haft slices the
    hand of the evil ones. Only a true Child of Stone, lover and beloved of Moradin,
    may awaken the true powers of the axe, and only with the sacred word Rudnogg
    on the lips.'"
