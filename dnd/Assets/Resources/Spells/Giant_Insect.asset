  Description:
  - You transform up to ten centipedes, three spiders, five wasps, or one scorpion
    within range into giant versions of their natural forms for the duration. A centipede
    becomes a giant centipede, a spider becomes a giant spider, a wasp becomes a
    giant wasp, and a scorpion becomes a giant scorpion. Each creature obeys your
    verbal commands, and in combat, they act on your turn each round. The DM has
    the statistics for these creatures and resolves their actions and movement. A
    creature remains in its giant size for the duration, until it drops to 0 hit
    points, or until you use an action to dismiss the effect on it. The DM might
    allow you to choose different targets. For example, if you transform a bee, its
    giant version might have the same statistics as a giant wasp.
