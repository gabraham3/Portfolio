  Description:
  - "You attempt to send one creature that you can see within range to another plane
    of existence. The target must succeed on a Charisma saving throw or be banished.
    If the target is native to the plane of existence you\u2019re on, you banish
    the target to a harmless demiplane. While there, the target is incapacitated.
    The target remains there until the spell ends, at which point the target reappears
    in the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.
    If the target is native to a different plane of existence than the one you\u2019re
    on, the target is banished with a faint popping noise, returning to its home
    plane. If the spell ends before 1 minute has passed, the target reappears in
    the space it left or in the nearest unoccupied space if that space is occupied.
    Otherwise, the target doesn't return."
  - At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or
    higher, you can target one additional creature for each slot level above 4th
  Level: 4th-level
