  Description:
  - "Describe or name a creature that is familiar to you. You sense the direction
    to the creature\u2019s location, as long as that creature is within 1,000 feet
    of you. If the creature is moving, you know the direction of its movement. The
    spell can locate a specific creature known to you, or the nearest creature of
    a specific kind (such as a human or a unicorn), so long as you have seen such
    a creature up close\u2014within 30 feet\u2014at least once. If the creature you
    described or named is in a different form, such as being under the effects of
    a polymorph spell, this spell doesn\u2019t locate the creature. This spell can\u2019t
    locate a creature if running water at least 10 feet wide blocks a direct path
    between you and the creature."
