  Description:
  - "You create the image of an object, a creature, or some other visible phenomenon
    that is no larger than a 20-foot cube. The image appears at a spot that you can
    see within range and lasts for the duration. It seems completely real, including
    sounds, smells, and temperature appropriate to the thing depicted. You can\u2019t
    create sufficient heat or cold to cause damage, a sound loud enough to deal thunder
    damage or deafen a creature, or a smell that might sicken a creature (like a
    troglodyte\u2019s stench). As long as you are within range of the illusion, you
    can use your action to cause the image to move to any other spot within range.
    As the image changes location, you can alter its appearance so that its movements
    appear natural for the image. For example, if you create an image of a creature
    and move it, you can alter the image so that it appears to be walking. Similarly,
    you can cause the illusion to make different sounds at different times, even
    making it carry on a conversation, for example. Physical interaction with the
    image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature
    that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion
    with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save
    DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see
    through the image, and its other sensory qualities become faint to the creature."
  - At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or
    higher, the spell lasts until dispelled, without requiring your concentration.
