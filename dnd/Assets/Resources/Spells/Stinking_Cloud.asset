  Description:
  - " You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of yellow, nauseating gas centered on a
    point within range. The cloud spreads around corners, and its area is heavily
    obscured. The cloud lingers in the air for the duration. Each creature that is
    completely within the cloud at the start of its turn must make a Constitution
    saving throw against poison. On a failed save, the creature spends its action
    that turn retching and reeling. Creatures that don\u2019t need to breathe or
    are immune to poison automatically succeed on this saving throw. A moderate wind
    (at least 10 miles per hour) disperses the cloud after 4 rounds. A strong wind
    (at least 20 miles per hour) disperses it after 1 round."
