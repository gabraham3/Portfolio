  Description:
  - "A veil of shadows and silence radiates from you, masking you and your companions
    from detection. For the duration, each creature you choose within 30 feet of
    you (including you) has a +10 bonus to Dexterity (Stealth) checks and can\u2019t
    be tracked except by magical means. A creature that receives this bonus leaves
    behind no tracks or other traces of its passage."
