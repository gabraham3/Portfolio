  Description:
  - "You call forth spirits to protect you. They flit around you to a distance of
    15 feet for the duration. If you are good or neutral, their spectral form appears
    angelic or fey (your choice). If you are evil, they appear fiendish. When you
    cast this spell, you can designate any number of creatures you can see to be
    unaffected by it. An affected creature\u2019s speed is halved in the area, and
    when the creature enters the area for the first time on a turn or starts its
    turn there, it must make a Wisdom saving throw. On a failed save, the creature
    takes 3d8 radiant damage (if you are good or neutral) or 3d8 necrotic damage
    (if you are evil). On a successful save, the creature takes half as much damage."
  - At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or
    higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 3rd.
