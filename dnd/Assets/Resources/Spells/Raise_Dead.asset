  Description:
  - " You return a dead creature you touch to life, provided that it has been dead
    no longer than 10 days. If the creature\u2019s soul is both willing and at liberty
    to rejoin the body, the creature returns to life with 1 hit point. This spell
    also neutralizes any poisons and cures nonmagical diseases that affected the
    creature at the time it died. This spell doesn\u2019t, however, remove magical
    diseases, curses, or similar effects; if these aren\u2019t first removed prior
    to casting the spell, they take effect when the creature returns to life. The
    spell can\u2019t return an undead creature to life. This spell closes all mortal
    wounds, but it doesn\u2019t restore missing body parts. If the creature is lacking
    body parts or organs integral for its survival\u2014its head, for instance\u2014the
    spell automatically fails. Coming back from the dead is an ordeal. The target
    takes a -4 penalty to all attack rolls, saving throws, and ability checks. Every
    time the target finishes a long rest, the penalty is reduced by 1 until it disappears."
