  Description:
  - "You and up to eight willing creatures who link hands in a circle are transported
    to a different plane of existence. You can specify a target destination in general
    terms, such as the City of Brass on the Elemental Plane of Fire or the palace
    of Dispater on the second level of the Nine Hells, and you appear in or near
    that destination. If you are trying to reach the City of Brass, for example,
    you might arrive in its Street of Steel, before its Gate of Ashes, or looking
    at the city from across the Sea of Fire, at the DM\u2019s discretion. Alternatively,
    if you know the sigil sequence of a teleportation circle on another plane of
    existence, this spell can take you to that circle. If the teleportation circle
    is too small to hold all the creatures you transported, they appear in the closest
    unoccupied spaces next to the circle. You can use this spell to banish an unwilling
    creature to another plane. Choose a creature within your reach and make a melee
    spell attack against it. On a hit, the creature must make a Charisma saving throw.
    If the creature fails this save, it is transported to a random location on the
    plane of existence you specify. A creature so transported must find its own way
    back to your current plane of existence."
