  Description:
  - A Large spectral guardian appears and hovers for the duration in an unoccupied
    space of your choice that you can see within range. The guardian occupies that
    space and is indistinct except for a gleaming sword and shield emblazoned with
    the symbol of your deity. Any creature hostile to you that moves to a space within
    10 feet of the guardian for the first time on a turn must succeed on a Dexterity
    saving throw. The creature takes 20 radiant damage on a failed save, or half
    as much damage on a successful one. The guardian vanishes when it has dealt a
    total of 60 damage.
