  Description:
  - Your magic turns others into beasts. Choose any number of willing creatures that
    you can see within range.You transform each target into the form of a Large or
    smaller beast with a challenge rating of 4 or lower. On subsequent turns, you
    can use your action to transform affected creatures into new forms.The transformation
    lasts for the duration for each target, or until the target drops to 0 hit points
    or dies. You can choose a different form for each target.A target's game statistics
    are replaced by the statistics of the chosen beast, though the target retains
    its alignment and Intelligence, Wisdom, and Charisma scores.The target assumes
    the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, it returns
    to the number of hit points it had before it transformed.If it reverts as a result
    of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its normal form.As
    long as the excess damage doesn't reduce the creature's normal form to 0 hit
    points, it isn't knocked unconscious. The creature is limited in the actions
    it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it can't speak or cast spells.
    The target's gear melds into the new form. The target can't activate, wield,
    or otherwise benefit from any of its equipment.
