  Description:
  - "You touch a willing creature. For the duration, the target\u2019s movement is
    unaffected by difficult terrain, and spells and other magical effects can neither
    reduce the target\u2019s speed nor cause the target to be paralyzed or restrained.
    The target can also spend 5 feet of movement to automatically escape from nonmagical
    restraints, such as manacles or a creature that has it grappled. Finally, being
    underwater imposes no penalties on the target's movement or attacks."
