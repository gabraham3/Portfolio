  Description:
  - " You shape an illusory duplicate of one beast or humanoid that is within range
    for the entire casting time of the spell. The duplicate is a creature, partially
    real and formed from ice or snow, and it can take actions and otherwise be affected
    as a normal creature. It appears to be the same as the original, but it has half
    the creature\u2019s hit point maximum and is formed without any equipment. Otherwise,
    the illusion uses all the statistics of the creature it duplicates. The simulacrum
    is friendly to you and creatures you designate. It obeys your spoken commands,
    moving and acting in accordance with your wishes and acting on your turn in combat.
    The simulacrum lacks the ability to learn or become more powerful, so it never
    increases its level or other abilities, nor can it regain expended spell slots.
    If the simulacrum is damaged, you can repair it in an alchemical laboratory,
    using rare herbs and minerals worth 100 gp per hit point it regains. The simulacrum
    lasts until it drops to 0 hit points, at which point it reverts to snow and melts
    instantly. If you cast this spell again, any currently active duplicates you
    created with this spell are instantly destroyed."
