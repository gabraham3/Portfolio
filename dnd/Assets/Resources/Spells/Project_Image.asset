  Description:
  - ' You create an illusory copy of yourself that lasts for the duration. The copy
    can appear at any location within range that you have seen before, regardless
    of intervening obstacles. The illusion looks and sounds like you but is intangible.
    If the illusion takes any damage, it disappears, and the spell ends. You can
    use your action to move this illusion up to twice your speed, and make it gesture,
    speak, and behave in whatever way you choose. It mimics your mannerisms perfectly.
    You can see through its eyes and hear through its ears as if you were in its
    space. On your turn as a bonus action, you can switch from using its senses to
    using your own, or back again. While you are using its senses, you are blinded
    and deafened in regard to your own surroundings. Physical interaction with the
    image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass through it. A creature
    that uses its action to examine the image can determine that it is an illusion
    with a successful Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save
    DC. If a creature discerns the illusion for what it is, the creature can see
    through the image, and any noise it makes sounds hollow to the creature.'
