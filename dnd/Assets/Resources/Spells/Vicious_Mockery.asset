  Description:
  - "You unleash a string of insults laced with subtle enchantments at a creature
    you can see within range. If the target can hear you (though it need not understand
    you), it must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or take 1d4 psychic damage and
    have disadvantage on the next attack roll it makes before the end of its next
    turn. This spell\u2019s damage increases by 1d4 when you reach 5th level (2d4),
    11th level (3d4), and 17th level (4d4)."
