  Description:
  - A thin green ray springs from your pointing finger to a target that you can see
    within range. The target can be a creature, an object, or a creation of magical
    force, such as the wall created by wall of force. A creature targeted by this
    spell must make a Dexterity saving throw. On a failed save, the target takes
    10d6 + 40 force damage. The target is disintegrated if this damage leaves it
    with 0 hit points. A disintegrated creature and everything it is wearing and
    carrying, except magic items, are reduced to a pile of fine gray dust. The creature
    can be restored to life only by means of a true resurrection or a wish spell.
    This spell automatically disintegrates a Large or smaller nonmagical object or
    a creation of magical force. If the target is a Huge or larger object or creation
    of force, this spell disintegrates a 10-foot-cube portion of it. A magic item
    is unaffected by this spell.
  - At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or
    higher, the damage increases by 3d6 for each slot level above 6th.
