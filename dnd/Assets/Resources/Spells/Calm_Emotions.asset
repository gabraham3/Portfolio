  Description:
  - You attempt to suppress strong emotions in a group of people. Each humanoid in
    a 20-foot-radius sphere centered on a point you choose within range must make
    a Charisma saving throw; a creature can choose to fail this saving throw if it
    wishes. If a creature fails its saving throw, choose one of the following two
    effects. You can suppress any effect causing a target to be charmed or frightened.
    When this spell ends, any suppressed effect resumes, provided that its duration
    has not expired in the meantime. Alternatively, you can make a target indifferent
    about creatures of your choice that it is hostile toward. This indifference ends
    if the target is attacked or harmed by a spell or if it witnesses any of its
    friends being harmed. When the spell ends, the creature becomes hostile again,
    unless the DM rules otherwise.
