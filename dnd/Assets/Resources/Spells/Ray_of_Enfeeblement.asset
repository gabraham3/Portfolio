  Description:
  - "A black beam of enervating energy springs from your finger toward a creature
    within range. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target
    deals only half damage with weapon attacks that use Strength until the spell
    ends. At the end of each of the target\u2019s turns, it can make a Constitution
    saving throw against the spell. On a success, the spell ends."
