    takes 1 hour to consume and disappears at the end of that time, and the beneficial
    effects don\u2019t set in until this hour is over. Up to twelve other creatures
    can partake of the feast.A creature that partakes of the feast gains several
    benefits. The creature is cured of all diseases and poison, becomes immune to
    poison and being frightened, and makes all Wisdom saving throws with advantage.
    Its hit point maximum also increases by 2d10, and it gains the same number of
    hit points. These benefits last for 24 hours."
