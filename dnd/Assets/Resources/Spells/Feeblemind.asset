  Description:
  - "You blast the mind of a creature that you can see within range, attempting to
    shatter its intellect and personality. The target takes 4d6 psychic damage and
    must make an Intelligence saving throw. On a failed save, the creature\u2019s
    Intelligence and Charisma scores become 1. The creature can\u2019t cast spells,
    activate magic items, understand language, or communicate in any intelligible
    way. The creature can, however, identify its friends, follow them, and even protect
    them. At the end of every 30 days, the creature can repeat its saving throw against
    this spell. If it succeeds on its saving throw, the spell ends. The spell can
    also be ended by greater restoration, heal, or wish."
