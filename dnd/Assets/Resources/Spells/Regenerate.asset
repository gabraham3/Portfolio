  Description:
  - "You touch a creature and stimulate its natural healing ability. The target regains
    4d8 + 15 hit points. For the duration of the spell, the target regains 1 hit
    point at the start of each of its turns (10 hit points each minute). The target\u2019s
    severed body members (fingers, legs, tails, and so on), if any, are restored
    after 2 minutes. If you have the severed part and hold it to the stump, the spell
    instantaneously causes the limb to knit to the stump."
