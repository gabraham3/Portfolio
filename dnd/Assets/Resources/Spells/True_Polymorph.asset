  Description:
  - "Choose one creature or nonmagical object that you can see within range. You
    transform the creature into a different creature, the creature into an object,
    or the object into a creature (the object must be neither worn nor carried by
    another creature). The transformation lasts for the duration, or until the target
    drops to 0 hit points or dies. If you concentrate on this spell for the full
    duration, the transformation becomes permanent. Shapechangers aren\u2019t affected
    by this spell. An unwilling creature can make a Wisdom saving throw, and if it
    succeeds, it isn\u2019t affected by this spell. Creature into Creature. If you
    turn a creature into another kind of creature, the new form can be any kind you
    choose whose challenge rating is equal to or less than the target\u2019s (or
    its level, if the target doesn\u2019t have a challenge rating). The target\u2019s
    game statistics, including mental ability scores, are replaced by the statistics
    of the new form. It retains its alignment and personality. The target assumes
    the hit points of its new form, and when it reverts to its normal form, the creature
    returns to the number of hit points it had before it transformed. If it reverts
    as a result of dropping to 0 hit points, any excess damage carries over to its
    normal form. As long as the excess damage doesn\u2019t reduce the creature\u2019s
    normal form to 0 hit points, it isn\u2019t knocked unconscious. The creature
    is limited in the actions it can perform by the nature of its new form, and it
    can\u2019t speak, cast spells, or take any other action that requires hands or
    speech unless its new form is capable of such actions. The target\u2019s gear
    melds into the new form. The creature can\u2019t activate, use, wield, or otherwise
    benefit from any of its equipment.Object into Creature. You can turn an object
    into any kind of creature, as long as the creature\u2019s size is no larger than
    the object\u2019s size and the creature\u2019s challenge rating is 9 or lower.
    The creature is friendly to you and your companions. It acts on each of your
    turns. You decide what action it takes and how it moves. The DM has the creature\u2019s
    statistics and resolves all of its actions and movement. If the spell becomes
    permanent, you no longer control the creature. It might remain friendly to you,
    depending on how you have treated it. Creature into Object. If you turn a creature
    into an object, it transforms along with whatever it is wearing and carrying
    into that form. The creature\u2019s statistics become those of the object, and
    the creature has no memory of time spent in this form, after the spell ends and
    it returns to its normal form."
