  Description:
  - " This spell allows you to change the appearance of any number of creatures that
    you can see within range. You give each target you choose a new, illusory appearance.
    An unwilling target can make a Charisma saving throw, and if it succeeds, it
    is unaffected by this spell. The spell disguises physical appearance as well
    as clothing, armor, weapons, and equipment. You can make each creature seem 1
    foot shorter or taller and appear thin, fat, or in between. You can\u2019t change
    a target\u2019s body type, so you must choose a form that has the same basic
    arrangement of limbs. Otherwise, the extent of the illusion is up to you. The
    spell lasts for the duration, unless you use your action to dismiss it sooner.
    The changes wrought by this spell fail to hold up to physical inspection. For
    example, if you use this spell to add a hat to a creature\u2019s outfit, objects
    pass through the hat, and anyone who touches it would feel nothing or would feel
    the creature\u2019s head and hair. If you use this spell to appear thinner than
    you are, the hand of someone who reaches out to touch you would bump into you
    while it was seemingly still in midair. A creature can use its action to inspect
    a target and make an Intelligence (Investigation) check against your spell save
    DC. If it succeeds, it becomes aware that the target is disguised."
