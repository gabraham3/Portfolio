  Description:
  - Up to ten berries appear in your hand and are infused with magic for the duration.
    A creature can use its action to eat one berry. Eating a berry restores 1 hit
    point, and the berry provides enough nourishment to sustain a creature for one
    day. The berries lose their potency if they have not been consumed within 24
    hours of the casting of this spell.
