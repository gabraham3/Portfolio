  Description:
  - "You imbue plants within 30 feet of you with limited sentience and animation,
    giving them the ability to communicate with you and follow your simple commands.
    You can question plants about events in the spell\u2019s area within the past
    day, gaining information about creatures that have passed, weather, and other
    circumstances. You can also turn difficult terrain caused by plant growth (such
    as thickets and undergrowth) into ordinary terrain that lasts for the duration.
    Or you can turn ordinary terrain where plants are present into difficult terrain
    that lasts for the duration, causing vines and branches to hinder pursuers, for
    example. Plants might be able to perform other tasks on your behalf, at the DM\u2019s
    discretion. The spell doesn\u2019t enable plants to uproot themselves and move
    about, but they can freely move branches, tendrils, and stalks. If a plant creature
    is in the area, you can communicate with it as if you shared a common language,
    but you gain no magical ability to influence it. This spell can cause the plants
    created by the entangle spell to release a restrained creature."
