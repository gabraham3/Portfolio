  Description:
  - "You summon fey spirits that take the form of beasts and appear in unoccupied
    spaces that you can see within range. Choose one of the following options for
    what appears: \u2022 One beast of challenge rating 2 or lower \u2022 Two beasts
    of challenge rating 1 or lower \u2022 Four beasts of challenge rating 1/2 or
    lower \u2022 Eight beasts of challenge rating 1/4 or lower Each beast is also
    considered fey, and it disappears when it drops to 0 hit points or when the spell
    ends. The summoned creatures are friendly to you and your companions. Roll initiative
    for the summoned creatures as a group, which has its own turns. They obey any
    verbal commands that you issue to them (no action required by you). If you don\u2019t
    issue any commands to them, they defend themselves from hostile creatures, but
    otherwise take no actions. The DM has the creatures\u2019 statistics."
  - 'At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using certain higher-level spell
    slots, you choose one of the summoning options above, and more creatures appear:
    twice as many with a 5th-level slot, three times as many with a 7th-level slot,
    and four times as many with a 9th-level slot.'
