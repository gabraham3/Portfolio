  Description:
  - "You touch a dead humanoid or a piece of a dead humanoid. Provided that the creature
    has been dead no longer than 10 days, the spell forms a new adult body for it
    and then calls the soul to enter that body. If the target\u2019s soul isn\u2019t
    free or willing to do so, the spell fails. The magic fashions a new body for
    the creature to inhabit, which likely causes the creature\u2019s race to change.
    The DM rolls a d100 and consults the following table to determine what form the
    creature takes when restored to life, or the DM chooses a form. d100 01-04 05-13
    14-21 22-25 26-34 35-42 43-46 47-52 53-56 57-60 61-68 69-76 77-96 97-00 Race
    Dragonborn Dwarf, hill Dwarf, mountain Elf, dark Elf, high Elf, wood Gnome, forest
    Gnome, rock Half-elf Half-orc Halfling, lightfoot Halfling, stout Human Tiefling
    The reincarnated creature recalls its former life and experiences. It retains
    the capabilities it had in its original form, except it exchanges its original
    race for the new one and changes its racial traits accordingly."
