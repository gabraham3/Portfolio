  Description:
  - "Choose one creature, object, or magical effect within range. Any spell of 3rd
    level or lower on the target ends. For each spell of 4th level or higher on the
    target, make an ability check using your spellcasting ability. The DC equals
    10 + the spell\u2019s level. On a successful check, the spell ends."
  - "At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or
    higher, you automatically end the effects of a spell on the target if the spell\u2019s
    level is equal to or less than the level of the spell slot you used."
