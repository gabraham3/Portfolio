  Description:
  - "You attempt to beguile a creature that you can see within range. It must succeed
    on a Wisdom saving throw or be charmed by you for the duration. If you or creatures
    that are friendly to you are fighting it, it has advantage on the saving throw.
    While the creature is charmed, you have a telepathic link with it as long as
    the two of you are on the same plane of existence. You can use this telepathic
    link to issue commands to the creature while you are conscious (no action required),
    which it does its best to obey. You can specify a simple and general course of
    action, such as 'Attack that creature,' 'Run over there,' or 'Fetch that object.'
    If the creature completes the order and doesn\u2019t receive further direction
    from you, it defends and preserves itself to the best of its ability. You can
    use your action to take total and precise control of the target. Until the end
    of your next turn, the creature takes only the actions you choose, and doesn\u2019t
    do anything that you don\u2019t allow it to do. During this time, you can also
    cause the creature to use a reaction, but this requires you to use your own reaction
    as well. Each time the target takes damage, it makes a new Wisdom saving throw
    against the spell. If the saving throw succeeds, the spell ends."
  - At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell with a 9th-level spell slot, the duration
    is concentration, up to 8 hours.
