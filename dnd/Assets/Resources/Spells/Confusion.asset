  Description:
  - "This spell assaults and twists creatures' minds, spawning delusions and provoking
    uncontrolled action. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius sphere centered on a point
    you choose within range must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw when you cast this
    spell or be affected by it. An affected target can\u2019t take reactions and
    must roll a d10 at the start of each of its turns to determine its behavior for
    that turn. d10 Behavior 1 The creature uses all its movement to move in a random
    direction. To determine the direction, roll a d8 and assign a direction to each
    die face. The creature doesn\u2019t take an action this turn. 2-6 The creature
    doesn\u2019t move or take actions this turn. 7-8 The creature uses its action
    to make a melee attack against a randomly determined creature within its reach.
    If there is no creature within its reach, the creature does nothing this turn.
    9-10 The creature can act and move normally. At the end of each of its turns,
    an affected target can make a Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, this effect
    ends for that target."
  - At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or
    higher, the radius of the sphere increases by 5 feet for each slot level above
    4th.
