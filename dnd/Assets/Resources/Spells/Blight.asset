  Description:
  - "Necromantic energy washes over a creature of your choice that you can see within
    range, draining moisture and vitality from it. The target must make a Constitution
    saving throw. The target takes 8d8 necrotic damage on a failed save, or half
    as much damage on a successful one. This spell has no effect on undead or constructs.
    If you target a plant creature or a magical plant, it makes the saving throw
    with disadvantage, and the spell deals maximum damage to it. If you target a
    nonmagical plant that isn\u2019t a creature, such as a tree or shrub, it doesn\u2019t
    make a saving throw; it simply withers and dies."
  - At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or
    higher, the damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.
