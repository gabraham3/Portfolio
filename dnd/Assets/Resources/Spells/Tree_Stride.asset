  Description:
  - "You gain the ability to enter a tree and move from inside it to inside another
    tree of the same kind within 500 feet. Both trees must be living and at least
    the same size as you. You must use 5 feet of movement to enter a tree. You instantly
    know the location of all other trees of the same kind within 500 feet and, as
    part of the move used to enter the tree, can either pass into one of those trees
    or step out of the tree you\u2019re in. You appear in a spot of your choice within
    5 feet of the destination tree, using another 5 feet of movement. If you have
    no movement left, you appear within 5 feet of the tree you entered. You can use
    this transportation ability once per round for the duration. You must end each
    turn outside a tree."
