  Description:
  - "You touch a creature, and that creature must succeed on a Wisdom saving throw
    or become cursed for the duration of the spell. When you cast this spell, choose
    the nature of the curse from the following options: \u2022 Choose one ability
    score. While cursed, the target has disadvantage on ability checks and saving
    throws made with that ability score. \u2022 While cursed, the target has disadvantage
    on attack rolls against you. \u2022 While cursed, the target must make a Wisdom
    sav ing throw at the start of each of its turns. If it fails, it wastes its action
    that turn doing nothing. \u2022 While the target is cursed, your attacks and
    spells deal an extra 1d8 necrotic damage to the target. A remove curse spell
    ends this effect. At the DM\u2019s option, you may choose an alternative curse
    effect, but it should be no more powerful than those described above. The DM
    has final say on such a curse\u2019s effect."
  - "At Higher Levels. If you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or
    higher, the duration is concentration, up to 10 minutes. If you use a spell slot
    of 5th level or higher, the duration is 8 hours. If you use a spell slot of 7th
    level or higher, the duration is 24 hours. If you use a 9th level spell slot,
    the spell lasts until it is dispelled. Using a spell slot of 5th level or higher
    grants a duration that doesn\u2019t require concentration."
