  Description:
  - "For the spell\u2019s duration, your eyes become an inky void imbued with dread
    power. One creature of your choice within 60 feet of you that you can see must
    succeed on a Wisdom saving throw or be affected by one of the following effects
    of your choice for the duration. On each of your turns until the spell ends,
    you can use your action to target another creature but can\u2019t target a creature
    again if it has succeeded on a saving throw against this casting of eyebite.
    Asleep. The target falls unconscious. It wakes up if it takes any damage or if
    another creature uses its action to shake the sleeper awake. Panicked. The target
    is frightened of you. On each of its turns, the frightened creature must take
    the Dash action and move away from you by the safest and shortest available route,
    unless there is nowhere to move. If the target moves to a place at least 60 feet
    away from you where it can no longer see you, this effect ends. Sickened. The
    target has disadvantage on attack rolls and ability checks. At the end of each
    of its turns, it can make another Wisdom saving throw. If it succeeds, the effect
    ends."
