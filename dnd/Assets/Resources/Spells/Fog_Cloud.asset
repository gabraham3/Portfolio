  Description:
  - You create a 20-foot-radius sphere of fog centered on a point within range. The
    sphere spreads around corners, and its area is heavily obscured. It lasts for
    the duration or until a wind of moderate or greater speed (at least 10 miles
    per hour) disperses it.
  - At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or
    higher, the radius of the fog increases by 20 feet for each slot level above
    1st.
  Level: 1st-level
