  Description:
  - "A sphere of shimmering force encloses a creature or object of Large size or
    smaller within range. An unwilling creature must make a Dexterity saving throw.
    On a failed save, the creature is enclosed for the duration.Nothing\u2014not
    physical objects, energy, or other spell effects\u2014can pass through the barrier,
    in or out, though a creature in the sphere can breathe there. The sphere is immune
    to all damage, and a creature or object inside can\u2019t be damaged by attacks
    or effects originating from outside, nor can a creature inside the sphere damage
    anything outside it.The sphere is weightless and just large enough to contain
    the creature or object inside. An enclosed creature can use its action to push
    against the sphere\u2019s walls and thus roll the sphere at up to half the creature\u2019s
    speed. Similarly, the globe can be picked up and moved by other creatures.A disintegrate
    spell targeting the globe destroys it without harming anything inside it."
