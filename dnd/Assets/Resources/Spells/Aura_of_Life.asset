  Description:
  - Life-preserving energy radiates from you in an aura with a 30-foot radius. Until
    the spell ends, the aura moves with you, centered on you. Each nonhostile creature
    in the aura (including you) has resistance to necrotic damage, and its hit point
    maximum can't be reduced. In addition, a nonhostile, living creature regains
    1 hit point when it starts its turn in the aura with 0 hit points.
  Level: 4th-level
