  School: Conjuration
  Description:
  - You hide a chest, and all its contents, on the Ethereal Plane. You must touch
    the chest and the miniature replica that serves as a material component for the
    spell. The chest can contain up to 12 cubic feet of nonliving material (3 feet
    by 2 feet by 2 feet). While the chest remains on the Ethereal Plane, you can
    use an action and touch the replica to recall the chest. It appears in an unoccupied
    space on the ground within 5 feet of you. You can send the chest back to the
    Ethereal Plane by using an action and touching both the chest and the replica.
    After 60 days, there is a cumulative 5 percent chance per day that the spell's
    effect ends. This effect ends if you cast this spell again, if the smaller replica
    chest is destroyed, or if you choose to end the spell as an action. If the spell
    ends and the larger chest is on the Ethereal Plane, it is irretrievably lost.
