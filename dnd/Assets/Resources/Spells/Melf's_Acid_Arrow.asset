  - Wizard
  School: Evocation
  Description:
  - A shimmering green arrow streaks toward a target within range and bursts in a
    spray of acid. Make a ranged spell attack against the target. On a hit, the target
    takes 4d4 acid damage immediately and 2d4 acid damage at the end of its next
    turn. On a miss, the arrow splashes the target with acid for half as much of
    the initial damage and no damage at the end of its next turn.
  - At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 3rd level or
    higher, the damage (both initial and later) increases by 1d4 for each slot level
    above 2nd.
