  Description:
  - A vertical column of divine fire roars down from the heavens in a location you
    specify. Each creature in a 10-foot-radius, 40-foot-high cylinder centered on
    a point within range must make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 4d6
    fire damage and 4d6 radiant damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on
    a successful one.
  - At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 6th level or
    higher, the fire damage or the radiant damage (your choice) increases by 1d6
    for each slot level above 5th.
  Level: 5th-level
