  Description:
  - "You utter a divine word, imbued with the power that shaped the world at the
    dawn of creation. Choose any number of creatures you can see within range. Each
    creature that can hear you must make a Charisma saving throw. On a failed save,
    a creature suffers an effect based on its current hit points: \u2022 50 hit points
    or fewer: deafened for 1 minute \u2022 40 hit points or fewer: deafened and blinded
    for 10 minutes \u2022 30 hit points or fewer: blinded, deafened, and stunned
    for 1 hour \u2022 20 hit points or fewer: killed instantly Regardless of its
    current hit points, a celestial, an elemental, a fey, or a fiend that fails its
    save is forced back to its plane of origin (if it isn\u2019t there already) and
    can\u2019t return to your current plane for 24 hours by any means short of a
    wish spell."
