  Description:
  - "You create a sound or an image of an object within range that lasts for the
    duration. The illusion also ends if you dismiss it as an action or cast this
    spell again. If you create a sound, its volume can range from a whisper to a
    scream. It can be your voice, someone else\u2019s voice, a lion\u2019s roar,
    a beating of drums, or any other sound you choose. The sound continues unabated
    throughout the duration, or you can make discrete sounds at different times before
    the spell ends. If you create an image of an object\u2014such as a chair, muddy
    footprints, or a small chest\u2014it must be no larger than a 5-foot cube. The
    image can\u2019t create sound, light, smell, or any other sensory effect. Physical
    interaction with the image reveals it to be an illusion, because things can pass
    through it. If a creature uses its action to examine the sound or image, the
    creature can determine that it is an illusion with a successful Intelligence
    (Investigation) check against your spell save DC. If a creature discerns the
    illusion for what it is, the illusion becomes faint to the creature."
