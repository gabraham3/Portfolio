  Description:
  - An immobile, faintly shimmering barrier springs into existence in a 10-foot radius
    around you and remains for the duration. Any spell of 5th level or lower cast
    from outside the barrier can't affect creatures or objects within it, even if
    the spell is cast using a higher level spell slot. Such a spell can target creatures
    and objects within the barrier, but the spell has no effect on them. Similarly,
    the area within the barrier is excluded from the areas affected by such spells.
  - At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 7th level or
    higher, the barrier blocks spells of one level higher for each slot level above
    6th.
  Level: 6th-level
  score: 0
