  Description:
  - "The next time you make a ranged weapon attack during the spell\u2019s duration,
    the weapon\u2019s ammunition, or the weapon itself if it\u2019s a thrown weapon,
    transforms into a bolt of lightning. Make the attack roll as normal. The target
    takes 4d8 lightning damage on a hit, or half as much damage on a miss, instead
    of the weapon\u2019s normal damage. Whether you hit or miss, each creature within
    10 feet of the target must make a Dexterity saving throw. Each of these creatures
    takes 2d8 lightning damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful
    one. The piece of ammunition or weapon then returns to its normal form."
  - At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 4th level or
    higher, the damage for both effects of the spell increases by 1d8 for each slot
    level above 3rd.
