  Description:
  - "You invoke the power of Hadar, the Dark Hunger. Tendrils of dark energy erupt
    from you and batter all creatures within 10 feet of you. Each creature in that
    area must make a Strength saving throw. On a failed save, a target takes 2d6
    necrotic damage and can\u2019t take reactions until its next turn. On a successful
    save, the creature takes half damage, but suffers no other effect."
  - At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 2nd level or
    higher, the damage increases by 1d6 for each slot level above 1st.
