  Description:
  - "You take control of the weather within 5 miles of you for the duration. You
    must be outdoors to cast this spell. Moving to a place where you don\u2019t have
    a clear path to the sky ends the spell early. When you cast the spell, you change
    the current weather conditions, which are determined by the DM based on the climate
    and season. You can change precipitation, temperature, and wind. It takes 1d4
    x 10 minutes for the new conditions to take effect. Once they do so, you can
    change the conditions again. When the spell ends, the weather gradually returns
    to normal. When you change the weather conditions, find a current condition on
    the following tables and change its stage by one, up or down. When changing the
    wind, you can change its direction.  Precipitation Stage Condition 1 Clear 2
    Light clouds 3 Overcast or ground fog 4 Rain, hail, or snow 5 Torrential rain,
    driving hail, or blizzard Temperature Stage Condition 1 Unbearable heat 2 Hot
    3 Warm 4 Cool 5 Cold 6 Arctic cold Wind Stage Condition 1 Calm 2 Moderate wind
    3 Strong wind 4 Gale 5 Storm"
