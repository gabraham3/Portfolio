  Description:
  - " You touch a length of rope that is up to 60 feet long. One end of the rope
    then rises into the air until the whole rope hangs perpendicular to the ground.
    At the upper end of the rope, an invisible entrance opens to an extradimensional
    space that lasts until the spell ends. The extradimensional space can be reached
    by climbing to the top of the rope. The space can hold as many as eight Medium
    or smaller creatures. The rope can be pulled into the space, making the rope
    disappear from view outside the space. Attacks and spells can\u2019t cross through
    the entrance into or out of the extradimensional space, but those inside can
    see out of it as if through a 3-foot-by-5-foot window centered on the rope. Anything
    inside the extradimensional space drops out when the spell ends."
