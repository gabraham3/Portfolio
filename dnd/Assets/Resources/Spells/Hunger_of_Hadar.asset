  Description:
  - You open a gateway to the dark between the stars, a region infested with unknown
    horrors. A 20-foot-radius sphere of blackness and bitter cold appears, centered
    on a point with range and lasting for the duration. This void is filled with
    a cacophony of soft whispers and slurping noises that can be heard up to 30 feet
    away. No light, magical or otherwise, can illuminate the area, and creatures
    fully within the area are blinded. The void creates a warp in the fabric of space,
    and the area is difficult terrain. Any creature that starts its turn in the area
    takes 2d6 cold damage. Any creature that ends its turn in the area must succeed
    on a Dexterity saving throw or take 2d6 acid damage as milky, otherworldly tentacles
    rub against it.
