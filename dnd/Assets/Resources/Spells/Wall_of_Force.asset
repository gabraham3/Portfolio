  School: Evocation
  Description:
  - " An invisible wall of force springs into existence at a point you choose within
    range. The wall appears in any orientation you choose, as a horizontal or vertical
    barrier or at an angle. It can be free floating or resting on a solid surface.
    You can form it into a hemispherical dome or a sphere with a radius of up to
    10 feet, or you can shape a flat surface made up of ten 10-foot-by- 10-foot panels.
    Each panel must be contiguous with another panel. In any form, the wall is 1/4
    inch thick. It lasts for the duration. If the wall cuts through a creature\u2019s
    space when it appears, the creature is pushed to one side of the wall (your choice
    which side). Nothing can physically pass through the wall. It is immune to all
    damage and can\u2019t be dispelled by dispel magic. A disintegrate spell destroys
    the wall instantly, however. The wall also extends into the Ethereal Plane, blocking
    ethereal travel through the wall."
