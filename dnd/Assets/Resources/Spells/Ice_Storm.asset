  Description:
  - A hail of rock-hard ice pounds to the ground in a 20-foot-radius, 40-foot-high
    cylinder centered on a point within range. Each creature in the cylinder must
    make a Dexterity saving throw. A creature takes 2d8 bludgeoning damage and 4d6
    cold damage on a failed save, or half as much damage on a successful one. Hailstones
    turn the storm's area of effect into difficult terrain until the end of your
    next turn.
  - At Higher Levels. When you cast this spell using a spell slot of 5th level or
    higher, the bludgeoning damage increases by 1d8 for each slot level above 4th.
  Level: 4th-level
