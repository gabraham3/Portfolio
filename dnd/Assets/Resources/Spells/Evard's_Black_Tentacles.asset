  Description:
  - Squirming, ebony tentacles fill a 20-foot square on ground that you can see within
    range. For the duration, these tentacles turn the ground in the area into difficult
    terrain. When a creature enters the affected area for the first time on a turn
    or starts its turn there, the creature must succeed on a Dexterity saving throw
    or take 3d6 bludgeoning damage and be restrained by the tentacles until the spell
    ends. A creature that starts its turn in the area and is already restrained by
    the tentacles takes 3d6 bludgeoning damage. A creature restrained by the tentacles
    can use its action to make a Strength or Dexterity check (its choice) against
    your spell save DC. On a success, it frees itself.
