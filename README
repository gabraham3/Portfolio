This is the portfolio of Gabe Turner.

The xv6 project handled the building of an operating system in xv6. This dealt with implementing Direct and Indirect blocks, Copy on Write, and OS procedures. This was for a class assignment and was built over the course of a semester equally spliting the work with one other person.
The dnd project was built in unity to be a tool that allows a user to look up rules, items and characters for the game dungeons and dragons. This used a system of reading csv files to add them as objects and read and manipulated them accordingly. This was built for a software engineering course and nearly all the code was designed and written by me with other group members handling design documents and the art assets with it.
The tea time project was for a video game design class. Me and a group of 3 others built it in the matter of 2 weeks and it is a simple platformer with basic combat implemented. My role was adding in the animations from the sprite sheet, adding the A* pathfinding, scene changes, bug fixing, and creating the combat including the players projectile logic
